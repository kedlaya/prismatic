      In this lecture, we study perfect prisms (i.e., prisms with a bijective Frobenius map) in detail. These end up being closely related to <term>perfectoid rings</term>,
      which appear frequently in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory; however, we will not use too much of the existing theory of perfectoid rings, and in fact we will end
      up recovering some of it via a different approach.

    <title>Distinguished elements in perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the condition of an element of a <m>\delta</m>-ring being distinguished is meant to capture the idea that
      <q>the <m>p</m>-adic order of vanishing equals 1</q>. For perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings, we can further develop this metaphor to assert that
      <q>the linear coefficient in <m>p</m> is a unit</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following will be used later in the discussion of perfect prisms (see <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>).
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-not-zerodivisor">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>p</m>-local, <m>p</m>-torsion-free, <m>p</m>-adically separated <m>\delta</m>-ring in which <m>A/p</m> is reduced
          (e.g., <m>W(R)</m> where <m>R</m> is a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra).
          Suppose that <m>d \in \Rad(A)</m> is a distinguished element.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the ring <m>A</m>, <m>d</m> is a non-zerodivisor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have <m>(A/d)[p^\infty] = (A/d)[p]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove (1), suppose by way of contradiction that <m>df = 0</m> for some nonzero <m>f \in A</m>.
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and <m>p</m>-adically separated, we may divide <m>f</m>
          by a suitable power of <m>p</m> to reduce to the case where <m>f \notin pA</m>. Now
          <me>
            0 = \delta(df) = f^p \delta(d) + \delta(f) \phi(d).
          </me>
          Multiplying by <m>\phi(f)</m> and using that <m>\phi</m> is a ring homomorphism, we obtain
          <me>
            0 = f^p \phi(f) \delta(d) + \delta(f) \phi(df) = f^p \phi(f) \delta(d).
          </me>
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>(p,d)</m>-local, <m>\delta(d)</m> is a unit in <m>A</m>, so 
          <m>f^p \phi(f) = 0</m>. Reducing modulo <m>p</m>, we obtain 
          <m>f^{2p} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}</m>. Since <m>A/p</m> is reduced, this implies <m>f \equiv 0 \pmod{p}</m>,
          contradicting our earlier choice of <m>f</m> and thus proving the claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (2), it is enough to show that <m>(A/d)[p^2] = (A/d)[p]</m>. 
          That is, given <m>f,g \in A</m> with <m>p^2 f = gd</m>, we must have <m>pf \in dA</m>.
          Since <m>gd \in p^2 A</m>, we have <m>\delta(gd) \in pA</m> and hence <m>\phi(g) \delta(gd) \in pA</m>.
          Rewriting this as <m>\delta(d) g^p \phi(g) + \delta(g) \phi(gd)</m>, we see that <m>\delta(d) g^p \phi(g) \in pA</m>.
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>(p,d)</m>-local, <m>\delta(d)</m> is a unit in <m>A</m>, so <m>g^p \phi(g) \in pA</m> and so <m>g^{2p} \in pA</m>.
          Because <m>A/p</m> is reduced, this implies <m>g \in pA</m>; since <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, this implies that <m>pf \in dA</m> as desired.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Lemma 2.34.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-perfect">
      <statement>
        <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra. Then <m>d = \sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n] p^n \in W(R)</m> is distinguished if and only if <m>(x_0, x_1)</m> is the trivial
        ideal of <m>R</m>. In particular, if <m>d \in \Rad(W(R))</m> (which means <m>x_0 \in \Rad(R)</m>), then <m>d</m> is distinguished if and only if <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Use <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence"/> to write <m>d^p \equiv [x_0]^p \pmod{p^2}</m> and
          <me>
            p\delta(d) = \phi(d)-d^p \equiv p [x_1]^p \pmod{p^2}
          </me>
          to deduce that the ideals <m>(p, d, \delta(d))</m> and <m>(p, [x_0], [x_1])</m> coincide.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The criterion for distinguished elements in <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> coincides with Fontaine's notion of a
        <term>primitive element of degree <m>1</m></term>. While this terminology was introduced in <xref ref="bib-Fontaine-Bourbaki"/>, it echoes similar constructions found elsewhere
        (e.g., <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-NG"/>).

      <p>
        A prism <m>(A,I)</m> is <term>perfect</term> if <m>A</m> is a perfect <m>\delta</m>-ring.

    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="lem-perfect-prisms-structure">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a perfect prism.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ideal <m>I</m> is principal, and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element and a non-zerodivisor.

            <p>
              We have <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m> and <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. In particular, <m>(A,I)</m> is a bounded prism.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-prism-ideal-generator"/>, the ideal <m>I</m> is principal and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element.
          By <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ring <m>A/(p)</m> is perfect (by functoriality) and derived <m>I</m>-complete (by <xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian"/>,
          it being the cokernel of <m>A \stackrel{\times p}{\to} A</m>). By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>A/(p)</m>
          is also classically <m>I</m>-complete. By induction on <m>n</m> using the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to p^{n-1}A/p^n A \to \to A/p^n \to A/p^{n-1} \to 0
          </me>
          and the isomorphism <m>A/p \cong p^{n-1}A/p^n A</m> of <m>A</m>-modules (a consequence of <m>A</m> being <m>p</m>-torsion-free),
          we deduce that each quotient <m>A/(p^n)</m> is classically <m>I</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and derived <m>p</m>-complete, it is also classically <m>p</m>-complete by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>.
          By the previous paragraph, it is also classically <m>(p, I)</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>, <m>A \cong W(A/p)</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a non-zerodivisor.
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The inclusion of the category of perfect prisms into <m>\Prm</m> admits a left adjoint. Given a prism <m>(A, I)</m>, the left adjoint is obtained by taking
          the classical <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of the coperfection of <m>A</m> (which we call the <term>coperfection</term> of <m>(A,I)</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>A'</m> be the coperfection of <m>A</m>; by <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A'</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. 
          Let <m>A''</m> be the classical <m>p</m>-completion of <m>A'</m>; by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>, <m>A''</m> is also the derived <m>p</m>-completion.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A</m>.
          Now <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A'' \cong W(A''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each positive integer <m>n</m>, we may now argue as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> that the derived <m>I</m>-completion of <m>A/p^n</m>
          coincides with the classical completion. Consequently, if we take <m>A'''</m> to be the classical <m>(p, I)</m>-completion of <m>A''</m> (or equivalently of <m>A'</m>), 
          then <m>A'''</m> also equals the derived <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of either <m>A'</m> or <m>A''</m>.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A'''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A''</m>.
          Again, <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A''' \cong W(A'''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, <m>(A''', IA''')</m> is a prism (the conditions on the ideal <m>IA'''</m> are implied by the corresponding conditions on <m>I</m>)
          and <m>A'''</m> is universal for maps of <m>A</m> to derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete <m>\delta</m>-rings. Thus the proof is complete.

    <title>Tilting and slicing</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For any prism <m>(A,I)</m> (perfect or not), define the <term>slice</term> (or <term>face</term>) of <m>(A,I)</m> as the ring <m>\overline{A} = A/I</m>.
        Define the <term>tilt</term> of <m>(A,I)</m> (or of <m>\overline{A}</m>), denoted <m>\overline{A}^\flat</m>, as the perfection of 
        <m>\overline{A}/p</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>(A,I)</m> is bounded, so that <m>\overline{A}</m> is classically <m>p</m>-complete.
        Using <xref ref="lem-maps-from-Witt-rings"/>, we may lift the projection map <m>\overline{A}^\flat \to \overline{A}/p</m> uniquely to a map 
        <m>\theta_A: W(\overline{A}^\flat) \to \overline{A}</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The term <term>slice</term> is not standard terminology.
        Another reasonable name would be the <term>special fiber</term>, in the sense that the prism is some sort of 
        <q>thickening</q> of the slice.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism with slice <m>\overline{A}</m> and tilt <m>\overline{A}^\flat</m>.
          We then have a commutative diagram as in <xref ref="fig-tilting-diagram"/> 
          in which the horizontal arrows are all surjective,
          the vertical arrows are all reductions modulo <m>p</m>,
          and the diagonal arrows are all isomorphisms. Moreover, this diagram is natural in <m>(A, I)</m>.

          Everything will follow once we construct a natural isomorphism <m>A \cong W(\overline{A}^\flat)</m>. By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>,
          it will suffice to construct a natural isomorphism <m>A/p \cong \overline{A}^\flat</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>, <m>I</m> admits a generator <m>d</m> which is a distinguished element.
          By definition, we have <m>\overline{A}/p = A/(p,d)</m>. For each positive integer <m>n</m>, the <m>n</m>-fold Frobenius
          <m>A/(p,d) \to A/(p,d)</m> identifies with the canonical map <m>A/(p,d^{p^n}) \to A/(p,d)</m> compatibly with <m>n</m>,
          so the limit <m>\lim_\phi \overline{A}/p</m> gets identified with <m>\lim_\phi A/(p, d^{p^n})</m>.
          The latter is naturally isomorphic to <m>A/(p)</m> because the latter is clasically <m>d</m>-complete

          It will suffice to explain how to recover <m>A</m> and <m>I</m> functorially from <m>\overline{A}</m>.
          Since <m>\overline{A}</m> is in the essential image of the functor, <m>\phi: \overline{A}/p \to \overline{A}/p</m> is surjective
          and so <m>\overline{A}^\flat \to \overline{A}/p</m> is surjective.
          Consequently, <m>\theta_A: W(\overline{A}^\flat) \to \overline{A}</m> is also surjective.
