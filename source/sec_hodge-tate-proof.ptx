      In this section, we prove the Hodge-Tate comparison theorem (<xref ref="thm-hodge-tate-comparison"/>).
      Our strategy will be to build up from the special case treated in <xref ref="sec_hodge-tate-crystalline"/>, in which we used the crystalline prism
      <m>(\ZZ_p, (p))</m> as the base and the ring <m>R = \FF_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also assert the crystalline and de Rham comparison theorems. These are technically a bit more involved, so we do not include all of the details here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, we fix a bounded prism <m>(A,I)</m> and denote its slice <m>A/I</m> by <m>\overline{A}</m>.

    <title>Étale localization and base change</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Recall that a morphism <m>R \to S</m> of rings is smooth if and only if locally on <m>\Spec(S)</m>, it can be written in the form
        <m>R \to R[x_1,\dots,x_r] \to S</m> where the second map is étale (see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 054L).
        Similarly, if <m>R \to S</m> is a <m>p</m>-completely smooth map, then locally on <m>\Spec(S/p)</m> it can be written in the form
        <m>R \to R \langle x_1,\dots,x_r\rangle \to S</m> where the second map is <m>p</m>-completely étale (use <xref ref="prop-Elkik-lifting"/> to reduce to
        the previous statement).
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>\overline{A} \to R</m> is <m>p</m>-completely smooth, then <m>\widehat{\Omega}^1_{R/\overline{A}}</m> is a finite projective <m>R</m>-module
        (again by <xref ref="prop-Elkik-lifting"/> to reduce to the corresponding statement about differentials for a smooth morphism).
        Consequently, if <m>R \to S</m> is <m>p</m>-completely étale, then <m>\widehat{\Omega}^i_{R/\overline{A}} \widehat{\otimes}_R S \cong \widehat{\Omega}^i_{S/\overline{A}}</m>
        for all <m>i</m>.
        </p>
      <p>
        This suggests the strategy of proving the Hodge-Tate comparison for a general <m>p</m>-completely smooth <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebra <m>R</m>
        by proving the corresponding compatibility with étale maps, and then using this to reduce to the case
        <m>R = \overline{A} \langle X_1,\dots,X_r \rangle</m>. The first step in this program is executed by <xref ref="lem-hodge-tate-etale-base-change"/>.

      <title>Étale localization for Hodge-Tate cohomology</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R \to S</m> be a <m>p</m>-completely étale map of <m>p</m>-completely smooth <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebras.
          Then the natural map <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_R S \to \overline{\Prism}_{S/A}</m> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The restriction functor <m>(S/A)_\Prism \to (R/A)_\Prism</m> admits a right adjoint <m>F</m> taking <m>(B \to B/IB \leftarrow R)</m> to
          <m>(B_S \to B_S/IB_S \leftarrow S)</m> where <m>B_S/IB_S = B/IB \widehat{\otimes}^L_R S</m> and <m>B \to B_S</m> is the unique lift of
          the étale morphism <m>B/IB \to B/IB \widehat{\otimes}^L_R S</m> given by the the henselian property of derived completions (see
          <xref ref="cor-derived-complete-local"/>), promoted from <m>\Ring </m> to <m>\Ring_\delta</m> using <xref ref="exer-etale-completion"/>.
          Applying <m>F</m> to a weakly final object of <m>(R/A)_\Prism</m> (<xref ref="prop-prismatic-site-weakly-final-object"/>),
          we obtain a weakly final object of <m>(S/A)_\Prism</m>; since <m>F</m> also preserves finite products, 
          we can take a complex computing <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m>
          and apply <m>F</m> term by term to obtain a complex computing <m>\overline{\Prism}_{S/A}</m>.
          It thus remains to compare this with <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_R S</m>;
          we have a natural isomorphism at the level of simplicial rings, and (since <m>R \to S</m> is <m>I</m>-completely flat
          and thus has finite <m>I</m>-complete Tor amplitude) we may now deduce the claim from <xref ref="exer-derived-completion-totalization"/>.

      Another tool we will use is a base-change assertion. This will allow us to simplify the base ring <m>\overline{A}</m> in some cases.

          Then <m>\Prism_{R'/A'}</m> is computed by the complex obtained by applying <m>\bullet \widehat{\otimes}_A A'</m> termwise.

    <title>Comparing a universal prism to a crystalline prism</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We reproduce <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture VI, Remark 2.2, in order to justify why we can't directly transpose the proof of the Hodge-Tate comparison from crystalline prisms to more general prisms.
        Suppose that <m>I = (d)</m>. Consider the object <m>P = A[x] \in \Ring_\delta</m> with <m>\delta(x) = 0</m>. Then the derived <m>(p,d)</m>-completion of <m>P\{\phi(x)/d\}</m>
        does <em>not</em> equal the derived <m>(p,d)</m>-completion of the divided power envelope of <m>(P, (x))</m>. A typical example of this is the case
        <m>(A, (d)) = (\ZZ_p\llbracket q-1 \rrbracket, ([p]_q))</m>; in this case, the derived <m>(p,d)</m>-completion of <m>P\{\phi(x)/d\}</m> will end up coinciding with the derived <m>(p,d)</m>-completion of the

          Since <m>d^p = p(\phi(d)/p - \delta(p))</m> is divisible by <m>p</m>, <m>B</m> is also classically <m>(p,d)</m>-complete.
          By <xref ref="cor-regular-sequence-divided-power-envelope"/>, <m>B</m> equals the classical <m>p</m>-completion of the divided power envelope of <m>(A, (d))</m>.

          The key point is to construct the map, as thereafter one can compute in local coordinates as in the proof of 
          <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/>. See <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Theorem 5.2.

        Before continuing, we make an observation that will explain a somewhat odd condition in <xref ref="thm-deRham-comparison"/>.
        Recall that by construction, the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vector functor <m>W</m> is a right adjoint to the forgetful functor <m>\Ring_\delta \to \Ring</m>
        (<xref ref="def-delta-ring-right-adjoint"/>).
        We may thus apply adjunction to the canonical map <m>A \to \overline{A}</m> to obtain a morphism <m>A \to W(\overline{A})</m> in <m>\Ring_\delta</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>\psi\colon A \to W(\overline{A})</m> be the composition of the resulting map with the Frobenius <m>\phi</m> on <m>W(\overline{A})</m>. This map carries <m>I</m> into <m>(p)</m>:
        the original map <m>A \to W(\overline{A})</m> carries <m>I</m> into the image of the Verschiebung <m>V</m> on <m>W(\overline{A})</m>, and the composition <m>\phi \circ V</m>
        is multiplication by <m>p</m> (<xref ref="def-Witt-Verchiebung"/>). Hence the map <m>\psi</m> induces a morphism
        <m>(A, I) \to (W(\overline{A}), (p))</m> of prisms provided that <m>W(\overline{A})</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free (so that the target is actually a prism).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-deRham-comparison">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume that the prism <m>(A,I)</m> is bounded and that <m>W(\overline{A})</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. 
          Let <m>R</m> be a <m>p</m>-completely smooth <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebra.
          Then there is a natural isomorphism <m>\Prism_{R/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_{A,\phi} \overline{A} \cong \Omega^\bullet_{R/\overline{A}}</m>
          of commutative ring objects in <m>D(\overline{A})</m> (where the completion is the derived <m>p</m>-adic completion).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In light of <xref ref="rmk-de-rham-comparison-setup"/>, it is enough to construct a functorial isomorphism of 
          <m>\Prism_{R/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_{A,\psi} W(\overline{A}) \cong \Prism_{R'/W(\overline{A})}</m>,
          where <m>R' = R \widehat{\otimes}_{\overline{A},\psi} W(\overline{A})/p</m> (and the stated isomorphism is given by <xref ref="lem-prismatic-base-change"/>), 
          with the crystalline cohomology of <m>R/p</m> with coefficients in <m>W(\overline{A})</m>.
          This amounts to an application of <xref ref="thm-crystalline-comparison"/>.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Theorem 6.4.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="thm-deRham-comparison"/>, the condition that <m>W(\overline{A})</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free holds in two natural cases of interest:
        when <m>A/I</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, or when <m>I = (p)</m> and <m>\overline{A}</m> is reduced.
        The result remains true without this condition, but this is 
        more difficult and falls outside the scope of these notes; see <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Corollary 15.4.
