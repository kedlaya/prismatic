      We conclude with some wild speculation about a potential link back to <m>\lambda</m>-rings (<xref ref="sec_lambda-rings"/>),
      particularly with regard to <m>q</m>-de Rham cohomology in the context of <m>\lambda</m>-rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notational warning: in this lecture, we use the notation <m>R\{J\}</m> to denote a free object in the category of <m>\lambda</m>-rings, not <m>\delta</m>-rings.

    <title>Divided power envelopes of <m>\lambda</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      We revisit the discussion of divided power envelopes of <m>\delta</m>-rings from <xref ref="sec_hodge-tate-crystalline"/>,
      starting by formulating a variant of <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta1"/>,
      in which we start with a larger ideal but do not require the base ring to be <m>p</m>-local.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta1-mod">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R_0 \in \Ring</m> be <m>\ZZ</m>-torsion-free.
          Let <m>R</m> be the free <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>R_0</m> on a single generator <m>x</m>, and let <m>J</m>
          be the ideal of <m>R</m> generated by <m>\delta^m(x)</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m>.
          Then the map from <m>R</m> to the divided power envelope of <m>(R, J)</m> promotes to a morphism of <m>\delta</m>-rings.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be the divided power envelope; it is the smallest subring of <m>R \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>
          containing <m>R</m> and <m>\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m>. 
          The maximal ideal on which <m>D</m> admits divided powers includes <m>\delta^m(x)</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m> by construction,
          and hence also <m>\phi(\delta^m(x)) = \delta^m(x)^p + p \delta^{m+1}(x)</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m>; consequently, for all <m>m \geq 0</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m>,
          <me>
            \phi(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))) = \gamma_n(\phi(\delta^m(x))) \in D
          </me>.
          Hence <m>\phi</m> induces an endomorphism of <m>D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that <m>\phi</m> induces a Frobenius lift on <m>D</m>; this amounts to checking that for all <m>m \geq 0</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m>,
          <me>
            \phi(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))) \equiv \gamma_n(\delta^m(x))^p \pmod{pD}
          </me>.
          We will see that in fact both sides are divisible by <m>p</m>. For <m>\phi(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))) = \gamma_n(\phi(\delta^m(x)))</m>, this holds by writing
          <me>
            \phi(\delta^m(x))) = p(\delta^m(x)^p/p) + p \delta^{m+1}(x) \in pD
          </me>
          and 
          <me>
            \phi(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))) = \gamma_n(\phi(\delta^m(x))) = p^n \gamma_n(\phi(\delta^m(x))/p)
          </me>.
          For <m>\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))^p</m>, this holds by writing
          <m>\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))^p = p! \gamma_p(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x)))</m> and applying <xref ref="eq-divided-power-composition"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>D</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, by <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift"/> we obtain a <m>\delta</m>-structure compatible with <m>R</m>, as desired.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      This statement and its proof transpose naturally to the <m>\lambda</m>-ring setting.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-divided-power-envelope-lambda">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R_0 \in \Ring</m> be <m>\ZZ</m>-torsion-free.
          Put <m>R = R\{x\}</m> (the free <m>\lambda</m>-ring over <m>R</m> on a single generator <m>x</m>),
          and let <m>J</m> be the ideal of <m>R</m> generated by <m>\lambda^m(x)</m> for all <m>m \geq 1</m>.
          Then the map from <m>R</m> to the divided power envelope of <m>(R, J)</m> promotes to a morphism of <m>\lambda</m>-rings.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be the divided power envelope; it is the smallest subring of <m>R \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>
          containing <m>R</m> and <m>\gamma_n(\lambda^m(x))</m> for all <m>m,n \geq 1</m>.
          The maximal ideal on which <m>D</m> admits divided powers includes <m>\delta^m(x)</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m> by construction,
          and hence also <m>\psi^p(\delta^m(x)) = \delta^m(x)^p + p \delta^{m+1}(x)</m> for each prime <m>p</m> and all <m>m \geq 0</m>; consequently, for each prime <m>p</m>
          and all <m>m,n \geq 1</m>,
          <me>
            \psi^p(\gamma_n(\delta^m(x))) = \gamma_n(\psi^p(\delta^m(x))) \in D
          </me>.
          We thus obtain a commuting family of endomorphisms <m>\psi^j</m> for all <m>j \geq 1</m> satisfying <m>\psi^{j_1j_2} = \psi^{j_1} \circ \psi^{j_2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the proof of <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta1-mod"/>, we verify that for each prime <m>p</m>, <m>\psi^p</m> induces a <m>p</m>-Frobenius lift on <m>D</m>.
          Since <m>D</m> is <m>\ZZ</m>-torsion-free, by Wilkerson's criterion (<xref ref="rmk-Adams-operation"/>) we obtain a <m>\lambda</m>-structure compatible with <m>R</m>, as desired.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      This in turn leads to a <m>\lambda</m>-analogue of <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta"/>.
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta-mod">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-lambda"/>, 
          the divided power envelope is generated as a <m>\lambda</m>-ring over <m>R_0</m> by the elements <m>\psi^p(x)/p</m> for <m>p</m> prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be the divided power envelope and let <m>D'</m> be the subring of <m>D \otimes_\ZZ \QQ = R \otimes_\ZZ \QQ</m> 
          which is the <m>\lambda</m>-subring over <m>R_0</m> generated by the elements <m>\psi^p(x)/p</m> for <m>p</m> prime.
          By <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-lambda"/>, we have <m>D' \subseteq D</m>; it thus remains to check the converse.
        </p>
        <p>
          We check that <m>\gamma_n(\delta^m(x)) \in D'</m> for all <m>m \geq 0</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m> by induction on <m>n</m>, with trivial base case <m>n=1</m>.
          The induction step is also trivial if <m>n</m> is not a prime power, as in this case <m>1/n!</m> belongs to the fractional ideal of <m>\ZZ</m> generated by
          <m>1/i!</m> for <m>i \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}</m>. If on the other hand <m>n = p^\ell</m>, then the difference between the fractional ideal of <m>\ZZ</m> generated by <m>1/n!</m>
          and the one generated by <m>1/i!</m> for <m>i \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}</m> is a factor of <m>n</m>; consequently, we may reduce to the case where <m>R_0</m> is <m>p</m>-local,
          in which case <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta"/> implies the claim.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark>
      <p>
        At this point, we can formulate a striking but not immediately meaningful analogue of <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/> as follows.
        Let <m>R_0 \in \Ring</m> be arbitrary and put <m>R = R_0[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>, viewed as a <m>\lambda</m>-ring with <m>x_1,\dots,x_r</m> constant.
        For <m>n \geq 0</m>, put
        <me> 
          P^n = R_0\{x_{ij}\colon i=1,\dots,r; j=0,\dots,n\}
        </me>
        (remembering that now we mean the free <m>\lambda</m>-ring) 
        and let <m>J^n</m> be the kernel of the morphism <m>P^n \to R</m> in <m>\Ring_\lambda</m> taking <m>x_{ij}</m> to <m>x_i</m> and <m>\lambda^m(x_{ij})</m> to <m>0</m>
        for all <m>m \gt 1</m>. Now consider the double complex displayed in <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline-lambda"/>.

      <p>
        In the diagram, we may argue as in <xref ref="lem-differentials-derived"/> to see that each row except the first is homotopic to zero.
        We may then apply the Poincaré lemma (<xref ref="prop-poincare-lemma"/>) to deduce that each column is quasi-isomorphic to <m>\Omega^\bullet_{R/R_0}</m>,
        and in particular each of the <m>n+1</m> morphisms between the <m>n</m>-th column and the <m>(n+1)</m>-st column induces the same isomorphism on cohomology groups.
        By <xref ref="map-of-double-complex-first-column-qis"/>, we deduce that the top row of <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline-lambda"/> is quasi-isomorphic to <m>\Omega^\bullet_{R/R_0}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, by <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta-mod"/>, we may identify <m>D_{J^n}(P^n)</m> with <m>P^n\{\psi^p(J^n)/p\}</m> (running over all primes <m>p</m>). 
        Here is where we get stuck: the latter object
        does not have any evident site-theoretic interpretation. However, in the <m>q</m>-analogue of this setup we will be able to provide such an interpretation.

      <proof>
        <p>
          In the following argument, all applications of derived Nakayama (<xref ref="rmk-derived-nakayama-isomorphism"/>) will be modulo <m>q-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the diagram, by derived Nakayama plus <xref ref="lem-differentials-derived"/> (or a direct argument), each row except the first is homotopic to zero.
          By derived Nakayama plus the Poincaré lemma (<xref ref="prop-poincare-lemma"/>, each column is quasi-isomorphic to <m>q\Omega^\bullet_{R/\ZZ,\square}</m>,
          and in particular each of the <m>n+1</m> morphisms between the <m>n</m>-th column and the <m>(n+1)</m>-st column induces the same isomorphism on cohomology groups.
          By <xref ref="map-of-double-complex-first-column-qis"/>, we deduce that the top row of <xref ref="fig-double-complex-q-crystalline-lambda"/> is quasi-isomorphic to 
          <m>q\widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{R/\ZZ,\square}</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Put <m>R = \ZZ[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>. Define the <term>global <m>q</m>-crystalline site</term> to be the opposite category to the category of global <m>q</m>-pd-pairs
        <m>(P, J)</m> equipped with isomorphisms <m>P/J \cong R</m>, equipped with the indiscrete Grothendieck topology. 
        By <xref ref="prop-q-divided-power-envelope-lambda"/>, the ring <m>D_{J^0,q}(P^0)</m> from
        <xref ref="def-global-site"/> yields a weakly final object in this category, so by <xref ref="lem-cech-cohomology-indiscrete"/> we can compute the cohomology of this site
        using the associated Čech-Alexander complex. This is precisely the top row of <xref ref="fig-double-complex-q-crystalline-lambda"/>,
        so <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex-global-q"/> gives us a quasi-isomorphism with <m>q\widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{R/\ZZ,\square}</m>.

    <title>Okay, now what?</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One would like to pursue the analogy with the <m>p</m>-local situation further, e.g., by comparing étale localization with the left Kan extension. 
        One dangerous point is that the Hodge-Tate isomorphism is going to be more subtle
        due to the lack of a conjugate filtration when not working in characteristic <m>p</m>; compare <xref ref="rmk-derham-comparison-char-0"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, one could try to define the analogue of a <term>prism</term> in this context, at least relative to the pair <m>(A, (q-1))</m>,
        and see where this leads. We shall see...

          View <m>\ZZ[x,y,q]</m> as a <m>\Lambda</m>-ring in such a way that <m>x,y,q</m> are all constant. Show that in the <m>\Lambda</m>-localization
          <m>\ZZ[x,y,q]\{(q-1)^{-1}\}</m>, we have
