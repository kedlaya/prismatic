      We describe an exotic Grothendieck topology on the category of schemes, the <term>arc-topology</term>, and its close relatives, the <term>h-topology</term>
      and <term>v-topology</term>. This will be useful in the study of the étale comparison map (<xref ref="sec_etale-comparison"/>).

    <title>Grothendieck topologies</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_prismatic-site"/>, we introduced <term>indiscrete Grothendieck topologies</term> as a shortcut to getting to the construction of prismatic cohomology.
      Since we will be discussing various Grothendieck topologies on the category of schemes, we must say a bit more now.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>Grothendieck topology</term> on a category <m>\calC</m> consists of a collection of (set-indexed) families of morphisms <m>\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}</m> 
        with a single target <m>U</m>, the <term>coverings</term>, subject to the following restrictions.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any isomorphism, viewed as a singleton family, is a covering.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}</m> is a covering and, for each <m>i</m>, <m>\{V_{ij} \to U_i\}_{j \in J_i}</m> is a covering, then the composition
              <m>\{V_{ij} \to U\}_{i \in I, j \in J_i}</m> is a covering. (In short, a covering of the terms in a covering gives a covering.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}</m> is a covering and <m>V \to U</m> is any morphism of <m>\calC</m>, then the fiber products <m>U_i \times_U V</m> exist
              for all <m>i \in I</m> and <m>\{U_i \times_U V \to V\}_{i \in I}</m> is a covering. (In short, the restriction of a covering is a covering.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A category equipped with a Grothendieck topology is called a <term>site</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <term>presheaf</term> on a site valued in <m>\Set</m> is a contravariant functor <m>F: \calC \to \Set</m>. A <term>sheaf</term>
          is a presheaf such that for every covering <m>\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}</m>, <m>F(U)</m> is the limit of the diagram
          <me>
            \prod_{i \in I} F(U_i) \rightrightarrows \prod_{(i_0, i_1) \in I \times I} F(U_{i_0} \times_U U_{i_1}).
          </me>
          The category of sheaves of sets on the site is called the <term>topos</term> associated to the site; it is in many ways a more canonical object,
          in that there are usually many different ways to construct families of coverings (or even underlying categories) that give rise to equivalent topoi.
          In particular, one can <q>sheafify</q> the definition of a morphism of sites to obtain morphisms of topoi, some of which do not arise from morphisms
          of the underlying sites.  We will not dwell on this too much here, but see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 00X9.

    <title>Valuation rings</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>valuation ring</term> is a local integral domain <m>V</m> which, as a subring of its fraction field <m>K</m>, is maximal with respect to local inclusions
        of local rings. In this case, the group <m>\Gamma = K^\times/V^\times</m> (the <term>value group</term> of <m>A</m>) 
        is totally ordered with the nonnegative elements being <m>(V \setminus \{0\})/V^\times</m>.
        See <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 00I8 for more on valuation rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We say that <m>V</m> is <term>eudoxian</term> if its value group satisfies the equivalent conditions of <xref ref="lem-eudoxian"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We define an <term>arc</term> to be a scheme of the form <m>\Spec(V)</m> where <m>V</m> is a eudoxian valuation ring. For example, a scheme which is the spectrum
        of a discrete valuation ring (sometimes called a <term>trait</term> or a <term>dash</term>) is an arc.
        (This terminology is hinted at in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/> but not actually introduced there.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-eudoxian">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>\Gamma</m> a totally ordered abelian group, the following statements are equivalent.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              For any two elements <m>\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma</m> with <m>\alpha, \beta \gt 0</m>, there exists a positive integer <m>n</m> such that 
              <m>n\alpha \gt \beta</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The group <m>\Gamma</m> admits an order-preserving isomorphism with a subgroup of the additive group <m>\RR</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It is obvious that (2) implies (1). Conversely, if (1) holds and <m>\Gamma</m> is nontrivial (as otherwise there is nothing to check), 
          we can fix a single <m>\alpha \in \Gamma</m> and define a function <m>f: \Gamma \to \RR</m> by the formula
          <me>
            f(\beta) = \sup\left\{\frac{r}{s}: r,s \in \ZZ, s \gt 0, s \beta \gt r \alpha\right\}
          </me>
          (condition (1) guaranteeing that the set in question is bounded above). We leave it to the reader to verify that this indeed gives
          an injective order-preserving homomorphism (<xref ref="exer-eudoxian"/>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        A typical example of a totally ordered abelian group not satisfying the conditions of <xref ref="lem-eudoxian"/> is the group <m>\RR \times \RR</m> with
        the lexicographic ordering.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        A eudoxian valuation ring is <term>microbial</term> in the sense of Huber <xref ref="bib-Huber"/>, but not conversely; the latter requires that there be a <q>leading term</q>
        while still having intermediate specializations. An example of a totally ordered abelian group that is not microbial is the infinite direct sum <m>\oplus_{m \in \ZZ} \RR</m>
        with the lexicographic ordering.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-arc-two-points">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>V</m> a valuation ring, <m>\Spec(V)</m> is an arc if and only if it contains at most two points
          (the <term>generic point</term> and the <term>special point</term>, which coincide if and only if <m>V</m> is a field).

    <remark>
      <p>
        Condition (1) in <xref ref="lem-eudoxian"/> is commonly called the <term>archimedean property</term> of a totally ordered group. We prefer the adjective
        <term>eudoxian</term> both for historical accuracy and to avoid creating confusion with the use of the term <term>nonarchimedean</term> in reference to an associated
        absolute value of a eudoxian valuation.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Recall (<xref ref="def-absolutely-integrally-closed"/>) that a ring <m>R</m> is said to be <term>absolutely integrally closed</term> (or <term>AIC</term>)
        if every monic polynomial over <m>R</m> has a root in <m>R</m>. When <m>R = V</m> is a valuation ring, this is equivalent to requiring that its fraction field
        is algebraically closed. In particular, any (eudoxian) valuation ring can be embedded in an AIC (eudoxian) valuation ring.

    <title>The arc-topology</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        As per <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/> (and an as yet unavailable sequel to <xref ref="bib-Rydh"/>), we say that a 
        morphism <m>f: Y \to X</m> of schemes is an <term>arc-covering</term> if for any morphism <m>\Spec(V) \to X</m> from an arc into <m>X</m>,
        there exists a commuting diagram as in <xref ref="fig-arc-covering"/> in which <m>\Spec(W) \to \Spec(V)</m> is a faithfully flat morphism of arcs.
        (We <em>do not</em> require the map <m>V \to W</m> to be integral.)
      </p>

      </figure>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-h-coverings-to-arc">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: Y \to X</m> be a morphism of schemes.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is faithfully flat, then it is an arc-covering.

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is proper and surjective, then it is an arc-covering.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Moreover, in both cases <m>f</m> is also a v-covering (see <xref ref="rmk-arc-v-h"/>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For (1), we first lift the closed point of <m>\Spec(V)</m>, and then lift generizations.
          For (2), we first lift the generic point of <m>\Spec(V)</m>, and then apply the valuative criterion for properness.
          In both cases, the condition that <m>V</m> is eudoxian plays no role.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Rydh"/>, Remark 2.5 or <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze-grassmannian"/>, Example 2.3.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>X = \Spec R</m> where <m>R \in \Ring</m> is noetherian. Then the map <m>R \to \prod_{\frakm} R^\wedge_{\frakm}</m>, where <m>\frakm</m> runs over the product of all maximal ideals
        of <m>R</m>, is a faithfully flat morphism and hence an arc-covering.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>X = \Spec(k[x,y])</m> be the affine plane over a field <m>k</m>, let <m>\tilde{f}: \tilde{Y} \to X</m> be the blowup at the origin,
        let <m>Y</m> be the complement in <m>\tilde{Y}</m> of a single closed point in the exceptional locus, and let <m>f: Y \to X</m> be the induced morphism.
        Then <m>f: Y \to X</m> is surjective but not an arc-covering: we can choose an arc whose special point maps to the origin in <m>X</m> and whose
        generic point maps to the direction corresponding to the missing point in the exceptional locus, and such an arc will not lift to <m>Y</m>.
        (Again, compare <xref ref="bib-Rydh"/>, Remark 2.5 or <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze-grassmannian"/>, Example 2.3.)
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The <term>arc-topology</term> on the category of schemes is the Grothendieck topology in which a family <m>\{f_i: Y_i \to X\}_{i \in I}</m> of morphisms is considered to be a covering
        if for any open affine <m>V \subseteq X</m>, there exists a map <m>t: K \to I</m> of sets with <m>K</m> finite and some affine opens <m>U_k \subseteq f_{t(k)}^{-1}(V)</m>
        for each <m>k \in K</m> such that the induced map <m>\sqcup_k U_k \to V</m> is an arc-covering.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-arc-v-h">
      <p>
        <xref ref="lem-h-coverings-to-arc"/> shows that the arc-topology includes many more coverings than the flat topology. This leads to some potentially confusing
        behavior: for instance, the structure presheaf <m>X \mapsto \Gamma(X, \calO)</m> is not a sheaf for the arc-topology, because its sheafification does not include nilpotents
        (the inclusion of the reduced closed subscheme is an arc-covering). This can (and generally should) be circumvented by working with derived categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, there is plenty of precedent for considering topologies of this nature. For example, Voevodsky <xref ref="bib-Voevodsky"/> considered the <term>h-topology</term>,
        generated by étale coverings and proper surjective morphisms. A more recent variant is the <term>universally subtrusive topology</term> of Rydh <xref ref="bib-Rydh"/>,
        which is defined similarly to the arc-topology except that the lifting property is required for all valuation rings, not just eudoxian ones;
        following <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze-grassmannian"/>, this is now commonly called the <term>v-topology</term>.
        For morphisms of finite type between noetherian schemes, the h-topology, the v-topology, and the arc-topology all coincide, but not otherwise; see <xref ref="exa-arc-covering-not-v-covering"/>
        for a minimal counterexample and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, section 1.1 for more discussion.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      We describe two fundamental examples of coverings.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-v-cover">
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a ring. Let <m>(A \to V_i)_{i \in I}</m> be a set of isomorphism class representatives of <m>A</m>-algebras which are AIC valuation rings
        of cardinality at most <m>\max\{\aleph_0, \#A\}</m> and put <m>B = \prod_{i \in I} V_i</m>. 
        The map <m>A \to B</m> is a v-covering: any morphism <m>f: A \to V</m> to a valuation ring factors through the intersection <m>\Frac(f(A)) \cap V</m>
        within <m>\Frac(V)</m>, and hence through some <m>V_i</m>. (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, Proposition 3.30.)
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-v-cover"/>, the connected components of the ring <m>V</m> are indexed by the set <m>I</m>. However, if <m>I</m> is infinite, then the spectrum of <m>V</m> is much larger
        than the set of kernels of projections <m>V \to V_i</m>: it also includes maximal ideals corresponding to <term>ultraproducts</term> of the <m>V_i</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-excision-for-valuation">
      <p>
        Let <v>V</v> be a valuation ring and let <m>\frakp</m> be a prime ideal of <m>V</m>. Then <m>V \to V_{\frakp} \times V/\frakp</m> is an arc-covering,
        but not a v-covering unless <m>\frakp</m> is zero or the maximal ideal. (See <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, Corollary 2.9.)

    <remark xml:id="exa-arc-covering-not-v-covering">
      <p>
        One can modify <xref ref="exa-excision-for-valuation"/> to obtain a finitely presented morphism, as follows.

        (see <xref ref="cor-arc-two-points"/>). Then for any <m>f \in V \setminus \frakp</m>, 
        <m>V \to V_f \times V/f</m> is an arc-covering but not a v-covering. (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, Example 1.3.)
