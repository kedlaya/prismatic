        However, we diverge significantly in form from these references; see below.

      In this section, we introduce a <m>q</m>-analogue of crystalline cohomology, derive a comparison with prismatic cohomology,
      and use this to establish a statement about the functoriality of <m>q</m>-de Rham cohomology after <m>p</m>-completion. We follow closely our analysis of the Hodge-Tate comparison
      for crystalline prisms (<xref ref="sec_hodge-tate-crystalline"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only present the affine part of the story, but one can globalize to obtain the <q>Wach module cohomology</q> of a smooth proper <m>\ZZ_p</m>-scheme.
      This is a primary motivation for seeking a global analogue (<xref ref="sec_q-global"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify the presentation, we only consider <m>q</m>-crystalline cohomology relative to <m>\ZZ_p</m>. A more general relative setup is described in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.

    <title><m>q</m>-divided powers</title>
    <p>
      In order to discuss <m>q</m>-crystalline cohomology, we first need to define a <m>q</m>-analogue of divided powers.
      It is not at all clear how to do this in general, but fortunately for our purposes it is sufficient to do this for <m>\delta</m>-rings.
      In that case, we can use the fact that divided powers can be accounted for using Frobenius (<xref ref="rmk-divided-power-envelope-criterion"/>) 
      to come up with a suitable analogue.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Throughout this section, view <m>A = \ZZ_p\llbracket q-1 \rrbracket</m> as a <m>\delta</m>-ring in which <m>q</m> is constant,
        and identify <m>A/([p]_q)</m> with <m>\ZZ_p[\zeta_p]</m> via the map taking <m>q</m> to <m>\zeta_p</m>.
        We will use frequently the fact that the ideals <m>(p,q-1)</m> and <m>(p, [p]_q)</m> of <m>A</m>, although distinct, do define the same topology on <m>A</m>;
        keep in mind that <m>(A, ([p]_q))</m> is a prism but <m>(A, (q-1))</m> is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also use on several occasions the congruence
        <men xml:id="eq-frob-q-cong"> 
          \phi([p]_q) = q^{p(p-1)} + \cdots + q^p + 1 \equiv p \pmod{[p]_q}.
        </men>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-q-divided-powers">
      <p>
        To see the difficulty at work here, imagine trying to define <m>q</m>-divided power operations <m>\gamma_{n,q}</m> using the formula
        <me>
          \gamma_{n,q}(x) = \frac{x^n}{[n]_q!}.
        </me>
        We would then have the rather awkward formula
        <me>
          \gamma_{n,q}(x+y) = \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{n! [i]_q! [n-i]_q!}{[n]_q! i! (n-i)!} \gamma_{i,q}(x) \gamma_{n-i,q}(y),
        </me>
        from which it is no longer apparent that being able to take <m>q</m>-divided powers of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> implies the same for <m>x+y</m>.

          By inspection, the arrow <m>A \to A'</m> is faithfully flat; we are thus reduced to checking that <m>A' \to C'</m> is <m>(p,[p]_q)</m>-completely flat.
          This can be checked by inspection: it is clear that <m>A' \to A'\{\phi(x/[p]_q)\} \cong A'\{y\}</m> is faithfully flat,
          and the quotient of <m>C'</m> by the completion of <m>A'</m>-submodule is itself the completion of a free module on the basis consisting of products of the form
          <m>x^{e_0} \delta(x)^{e_1} \delta^2(x)^{e_2} \cdots</m>, where <m>e_0, e_1, \ldots \in \{0,\dots,p-1\}</m> are almost all zero.

        Recall that in the ordinary divided power setting, a <m>\delta</m>-ring flat over <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m> admits divided powers on an ideal if and only if

        With this in mind, 
        for <m>D</m> a <m>[p]_q</m>-torsion-free <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A</m>, for any <m>x \in D</m> with <m>\phi(x) \in [p]_qD</m>, write

        With notation as in <xref ref="def-q-divided-power"/>, for <m>x,y \in \phi^{-1}([p]_qD)</m> we have

          We need to show that if <m>x \in D</m> and <m>\phi(x) \in [p]_qD</m>, then <m>\phi(\gamma(x)) \in [p]_q D</m>.

          to show that <m>\phi(\gamma(x)) \in [p]_q D</m>, it will suffice to show that <m>p \phi(\gamma(x)) \in [p]_q D</m>.
          Moreover, by <xref ref="eq-frob-q-cong"/> we may replace <m>p</m> with <m>\phi([p]_q)</m> on the left-hand side.

      <proof>
        <p>
          We make the same argument as in <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/>:
          each row is homotopic to zero by <xref ref="lem-q-differentials-derived"/>, and all of the simplicial maps induce quasi-isomorphisms of columns by <xref ref="lem-q-poincare-lemma"/>,
          so <xref ref="map-of-double-complex-first-column-qis"/> yields the desired quasi-isomorphism.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Theorem 2.9.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      To link up with prismatic cohomology, we need a <m>q</m>-analogue of the Cartier isomorphism.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-q-cartier">
      <p>
        For <m>R</m> an <m>\ZZ_p</m>-algebra, define <m>R^{(1)} = R \otimes_{\ZZ_p} \ZZ_p[\zeta_p]</m>; this will play the role of the <q>Frobenius twist</q> in this setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>(D,I)</m> be a <m>q</m>-pd pair with <m>D/I \cong R</m>.
        By assumption, <m>\phi(I) \subseteq [p]_q D</m> and so we get an induced map <m>R \cong D/I \to D/[p]_q</m> which is linear over the Frobenius on <m>A</m>.
        Linearizing yields an <m>A</m>-algebra map <m>A \otimes_{\phi,A} R \to D/[p]_q</m>, which then factors through <m>(A \otimes_{\phi,A} R)/[p]_q \cong R^{(1)}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The upshot of this is that for <m>R = \ZZ_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]^\wedge_{(p)}</m>, there is a morphism from the <m>q</m>-crystalline site of <m>R</m> to the prismatic site of <m>R^{(1)}</m> over <m>A</m>,
        and hence a morphism of cohomology in the other direction.

          Using <xref ref="def-q-cartier"/>, we obtain a morphism from <m>\Prism_{R^{(1)}/A}</m> to the <m>q</m>-crystalline cohomology (the top row of <xref ref="fig-q-double-complex-crystalline"/>.
          To check that it is an isomorphism, we may invoke derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>) to reduce modulo <m>q-1</m>,
          at which point we get back to the corresponding statement in the case of a crystalline prism (<xref ref="rmk-identify-prismatic-product-with-divided-powers"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="lem-prismatic-q-double-complex"/>, we obtain a quasi-isomorphism between the top row of <xref ref="fig-q-double-complex-crystalline"/> and the left column of the same diagram.
          Using <xref ref="lem-q-poincare-lemma"/>, we get a quasi-isomorphism of the left column with <m>q\Omega^\bullet_{R/\ZZ_p,\square}</m>.

        <xref ref="thm-q-prismatic-to-crystalline"/> gives us a way to regard <m>q \Omega^\bullet_{R/\ZZ_p, \square}</m> as a commutative ring object in <m>D_{\comp}(A)</m>
        functorially associated to <m>\ZZ_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>. We can thus use left Kan extension (<xref ref="prop-left-derived-quillen"/>) to extend the definition

    <title>Frobenius is an isogeny</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Put <m>R = \ZZ_p[x]^\wedge_{(p)}</m> and view <m>R \llbracket q-1 \rrbracket </m> as a <m>\delta</m>-ring in which <m>q</m> and <m>x</m> are constant. Then
        <m>q\Omega^\bullet_{R/\ZZ_p,\square}</m> carries an action of <m>\phi</m> given in degree <m>0</m> by <m>f \mapsto \phi(f)</m> and in degree <m>1</m> by
        <m>g\,dx \mapsto \phi(g) x^{p-1} [p]_q\,dx</m>. A similar statement applies to <m>R = \ZZ_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]^\wedge_{(p)}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows that for any derived <m>p</m>-complete <m>\ZZ_p</m>-algebra <m>R</m>, the linearized Frobenius <m>\phi_R: \phi_A^* \Prism_{R^{(1)}/A} \to \Prism_{R^{(1)}/A}</m>
        is an isogeny, in that it becomes an isomorphism after inverting <m>[p]_q</m>. More precisely, because the action on cohomology in degree <m>i</m> 
        factors through multiplication by <m>[p]_q^i</m>, one can apply the Berthelot-Ogus functor <m>\eta_{[p]_q}</m> (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0F7N);
        this is related to the discussion of the <term>Nygaard filtration</term> in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.

    <title>Étale localization</title>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One can establish a form of étale localization (<xref ref="lem-hodge-tate-etale-base-change"/>) in order to extend the preceding discussion to
        the case where <m>R</m> is a <m>p</m>-completely smooth <m>\ZZ_p</m>-algebra. In particular, for such rings the left Kan extension of <xref ref="def-q-de-Rham-left-Kan"/>
        can be computed by <q>naive</q> <m>q</m>-de Rham complexes using local coordinate choices.
