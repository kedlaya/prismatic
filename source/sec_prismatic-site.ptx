      In this section, we introduce the <term>prismatic site</term> of an affine scheme in the sense of <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>.
      This should perhaps be called the <term>naive prismatic site</term> because it does not give correct answers when one drops the affine hypothesis; see <xref ref="rmk-naive-prismatic-site"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that while we make some basic definitions in a rather expansive degree of generality, we will be unable to compute anything except
      under some smoothness hypotheses. We impose those starting in <xref ref="sec_hodge-tate"/>.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <title>Warning</title>
      <p>
        Our definition of the prismatic cohomology <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> is preliminary; it will be overridden later by the construction of
        <term>derived prismatic cohomology</term> in <xref ref="sec_derived-prismatic"/>.

    <title>Indiscrete Grothendieck topologies</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For a topological space <m>X</m>, let <m>|X|</m> be the (small) category consisting of the open subsets of <m>X</m>, where the set of morphisms
        from <m>U</m> to <m>V</m> is a singleton set if <m>U \subseteq V</m> and 0 otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        A presheaf on <m>X</m> valued in some category <m>\calC</m> is nothing but a contravariant functor <m>|X| \to \calC</m>.
        A presheaf <m>F</m> is a sheaf if and only <m>F</m> preserves the colimit of the diagram
        <m>
          \prod_{i,j \in I} V_i \cap V_j \rightrightarrows \prod_i V_i \to U
        </m>
        for any covering of an open subset <m>U</m> by open subsets <m>\{V_i\}_{i \in I}</m>.
        (Since the functor is contravariant, that means we get a limit in <m>\calC</m>.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Building upon this idea, one can define the notion of a <term>Grothendieck topology</term> on any category; the key point is to specify which families
        of morphisms to a given target are <term>coverings</term> of that target, and then the sheaf property on a presheaf is formulated in terms of diagrams as above.
        (A <term>site</term> means a category equipped with a Grothendieck topology.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To deal with the naive prismatic site, we only need the case of an <term>indiscrete</term> (or <term>chaotic</term>) Grothendieck topology, in which <em>no</em> families of morphisms
        are coverings except isomorphisms, and there is consequently no distinction between presheaves and sheaves. 
        What makes this interesting is that we do not assume that our category has a final object!
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\calC</m> be a small category; we can then form the category <m>\Pshv(\calC)</m> of presheaves of abelian groups on <m>\calC</m>.
        The functor <m>\Pshv(\calC) \to \Ab</m> given by
        <me>
          F \mapsto H^0(\calC, F) = \lim_{X \in \calC} F(X)
        </me>
        is left exact; we can then form its derived functor <m>R\Gamma(C, \bullet)</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-indiscrete-topology-on-poset">
      <p>
        Let <m>\calC</m> be the category <m>\{0 \to 1 \to 2 \to \cdots\}</m>; that is, the objects are nonnegative integers, and the morphisms from <m>i</m> to <m>j</m>
        form a singleton set if <m>i \leq j</m> and the empty set otherwise. In this case, we have
        <me>
          H^0(\calC, F) = \lim_n F(n), \qquad H^1(\calC, F) = R^1 \lim_n F(n)
        </me>
        and <m>H^i(\calC, F) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 2</m> (see <xref ref="exer-indiscrete-topology-on-poset"/>).
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      While the indiscrete Grothendieck topology on a small category becomes trivial if the category admits a final object (i.e., an object to which every other object maps
      uniquely), we will be interested in a slightly less rigid situation where the topology becomes both interesting and computable.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall that a <term>final object</term> in a category <m>\calC</m> is an object <m>X \in \calC</m> such that <m>\Hom_{\calC}(Y, X)</m> is a singleton set for every
        <m>Y \in \calC</m>. By contrast, a <term>weakly final object</term> in <m>\calC</m> is an object <m>X \in \calC</m> such that <m>\Hom_{\calC}(Y, X) \neq \emptyset</m>
        for every <m>Y \in \calC</m>. (That is, the natural map from the representable functor <m>h_X</m> to the forgetful functor <m>\calC \to \Set</m> is a bijection
        if <m>X</m> is final, but only surjective if <m>X</m> is weakly final.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>\calC</m> be the category of algebraic field extensions of a fixed field <m>F</m>, viewed as a full subcategory of <m>\Ring_F</m>. Then every algebraic closure of 
        <m>F</m> is a weakly final object of <m>\calC</m>, but not a final object unless <m>F</m> is itself separably closed.
      </p>

    <lemma xml:id="lem-cech-cohomology-indiscrete">
      <title>Čech-Alexander resolution</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\calC</m> be a small category admitting finite nonempty products and containing a weakly final object <m>X</m>.
          Then for any <m>F \in \Pshv(\calC)</m>,
          <m>R\Gamma(\calC, F)</m> is computed by applying <m>F</m> to the <term>Čech nerve</term> of <m>X</m> (see <xref ref="exa-cech-nerve"/>); that is, it is given by the <term>Čech-Alexander complex</term>

          in which the differentials are given by alternating sums as per <xref ref="def-simplicial-object"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Using the fact that the map from <m>h_X</m> to the forgetful functor is a surjection (and that <m>h_{X^n}</m> is a sheaf for all <m>n</m>
          because we are using the indiscrete topology), this reduces to the general Čech spectral sequence for a (not necessarily indiscrete)
          Grothendieck topology. See <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 07JM.

        Note that the category <m>(R/A)^{\op}_{\Prism}</m> depends on the whole prism <m>(A,I)</m> and not just on the underlying ring <m>A</m>. However,

        For <m>R = \overline{A}</m>, <m>(R/A)^{\op}_{\Prism}</m> is simply the category of prisms over <m>(A,I)</m>, and thus has the initial object

          <xref ref="exer-derived-completion-delta"/>). If <m>B_1</m> is <m>d</m>-torsion-free, then <m>(B_1, dB_1)</m> has the desired universal property.
          Otherwise, we transfinitely iterate the operations of taking the maximal <m>d</m>-torsion-free quotient and taking the derived
          <m>(p,d)</m>-completion; this terminates because a countably filtered colimit of derived <m>(p,d)</m>-complete rings is again
          derived <m>(p,d)</m>-complete (<xref ref="rmk-derived-filtered-colimits"/>), so we can stop taking the completions once we get to an uncountable ordinal.

        For some purposes, it is more natural to modify the definition of a prism to replace the ideal <m>I</m> with a <q>virtual Cartier divisor</q>, to provide
        some missing stability under base change. In this context <xref ref="lem-adjoint-delta-rings-to-prisms"/> becomes much more straightforward, as the issue
        with taking torsion-free quotients becomes irrelevant.

          It is equivalent to show that <m>(R/A)^{\op}_{\Prism}</m> admits finite nonempty coproducts.
          Let <m>(R \to B/IB \leftarrow B)</m> and <m>(R \to C/IC \leftarrow C)</m> be two objects of <m>(R/A)^{\op}_{\Prism}</m>.
          Form the <m>\delta</m>-ring <m>D_0 = B \otimes_A C</m> using <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-limits-colimits"/>.
          Let <m>J</m> be the kernel of the natural map

            D_0 \to B/IB \otimes_{A/IA} C/IC \to B/IB \otimes_R C/IC;
          </me>
          that is, <m>J</m> is generated by elements of the form <m>x \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes y</m> where <m>x \in B, y \in C</m> have the property
          that there is some <m>z \in R</m> mapping to <m>x \in B/IB</m> and to <m>y \in C/IC</m>. 
          Apply <xref ref="lem-adjoint-delta-rings-to-prisms"/> to the pair <m>(D_0, J)</m> to obtain a prism <m>(D, ID)</m>; the object
          <m>(R \to D/ID \leftarrow D) \in (R/A)^{op}_{\Prism}</m> is the desired coproduct.

    <remark>
      <p>
        One awkward feature is that a morphism <m>Y \to X</m> does not give rise to a pullback functor <m>(X/A)_{\Prism} \to (Y/A)_{\Prism}</m>, because there is no natural way to perform base change for prisms along
        a morphism at the level of slices. At the level of rings, this is saying that given an object <m>(R \to B/IB \leftarrow B)</m> of <m>(R/A)_{\Prism}</m> and a morphism <m>R \to S</m> of rings, 
        there is no natural way to promote the map <m>B/IB \to B/IB \widehat{\otimes}_R S</m> to a morphism <m>B \to *</m>.
        This is in fact a rather common issue with Grothendieck topologies; it also arises for the infinitesimal and crystalline sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard fix for this is to replace the <term>prismatic site</term> with its associated category of sheaves of sets, the <term>prismatic topos</term>. In this language,
        one can show (<xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Remark 4.3) that the functor <m>h_X: (B, IB) \mapsto \Hom_{\overline{A}}(\Spf(B/IB), X) </m> is a sheaf on the 
        site <m>(\overline{A}/A)_{\Prism}</m>
        and the <term>slice topos</term> over this functor is naturally equivalent to the topos of <m>(R/A)_{\Prism}</m>.
        (This also applies if we replace the indiscrete Grothendienck topology with the one in <xref ref="rmk-naive-prismatic-site"/>.)
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-naive-prismatic-site">
      <p>
        As pointed out above, what we are calling the <term>prismatic site</term> here (following <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>) should really be called the <term>naive prismatic site</term>.
        The site defined in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Definition 4.1 has a different Grothendieck topology: a morphism <m>(B, IB) \to (C, IC)</m> of prisms corresponds to a covering
        if and only if it is <m>I</m>-completely faithfully flat. This changes the resulting topos, but not the prismatic or Hodge-Tate cohomology; it also gives better results when replacing the ring <m>R</m>
        with a (usually smooth) <m>p</m>-adic formal scheme <m>X</m>, now with an object being given by a diagram as in <xref ref="fig-prismatic-site-object-full"/> (where <m>\Spf</m> is always taken with respect
        to the <m>p</m>-adic topology) to obtain the site <m>(X/A)_{\Prism}</m>.
