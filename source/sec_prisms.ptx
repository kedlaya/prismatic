      Using the framework of <m>\delta</m>-rings, we now set up the formalism of <term>prisms</term>, modulo a key technical detail:
      the difference between <term>classical completion</term> and <term>derived completion</term> with respect to an ideal.
      We postpone discussion of the latter until <xref ref="sec_derived-complete"/>.

      <title>Notation</title>
      <p>
        For <m>A \in \Ring</m>, let <m>\Mod_A</m> denote the category of <m>A</m>-modules.
        For an ideal <m>I</m> of <m>A</m>, and an object <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>,
        write <m>M[I]</m> for the <m>I</m>-torsion submodule of <m>M</m> and <m>M[I^\infty]</m> for the union <m>\bigcup_n M[I^n]</m>;
        if <m>I = (f)</m> is principal, we also notate these as <m>M[f]</m> and <m>M[f^\infty]</m>.

    <title>Distinguished elements and examples</title>
    <p>
      We begin by singling out elements of a <m>\delta</m>-ring which behave as if they <q>vanish to order <m>1</m></q>, as indicated by the <m>p</m>-derivation.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring. An element <m>d \in A</m> is <term>distinguished</term> if <m>(p, d, \delta(d))</m> is the unit ideal of <m>A</m>.
        That is, the intersection of the zero loci of <m>p, d, \delta(d)</m> on <m>\Spec A</m> is empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is <m>(p, d)</m>-local, then <m>d \in A</m> is distinguished if and only if <m>\delta(d)</m> is a unit in <m>A</m>;
        in fact this is the definition used in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/> and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.
        The discrepancy will not affect the definition of a prism because the latter already includes a completeness hypothesis (see <xref ref="def-prism"/>).
        One confusing aspect of our definition is that units in <m>A</m> are always distinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many arguments that follow, we can reduce to the <m>(p,d)</m>-local case by localizing <m>A</m> at <m>(p,d)</m>.
        By <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-localization"/>, the result is still a <m>\delta</m>-ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Any morphism in <m>\Ring_{\delta}</m> carries distinguished elements to distinguished elements. 
        The converse holds for the map <m>\phi</m>; see <xref ref="exer-distinguished-Frob"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      We describe a series of examples which will be related to various preexisting <m>p</m>-adic cohomology theories.
      We will promote these examples to prisms in <xref ref="exa-prism-examples"/>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-crystalline-prism">
      <title>Crystalline cohomology</title>
      <p>
        Take <m>A = \ZZ_p</m> with <m>d=p</m>. Then <m>\delta(d) = 1-p^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>, so <m>p</m> is distinguished.
        By the same token, by <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-image-of-Z"/>, <m>p</m> is distinguished in any <m>\delta</m>-ring.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-q-de-Rham-prism">
      <title><m>q</m>-de Rham cohomology and Wach modules</title>
      <p>
        Take <m>A = \ZZ_p \llbracket q-1 \rrbracket</m> with the <m>\delta</m>-structure for which <m>\phi(q) = q^p</m>,
        and define <m>d</m> to be the <q><m>q</m>-analogue of <m>p</m></q>:
        <me>
          d = [p]_q = \frac{q^p-1}{q-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} q^i.
        </me>
        Under the map <m>A \to \ZZ_p</m> taking <m>q</m> to 1, <m>d</m> maps to <m>p</m> which is distinguished in the target;
        it follows that <m>d</m> is itself distinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example is closely related to Fontaine's theory of <term><m>(\varphi, \Gamma)</m>-modules</term>.
        The original construction of Fontaine <xref ref="bib-Fontaine1"/> described an equivalence of categories between the 
        continuous representations of the absolute Galois group of <m>\QQ_p</m> on finite <m>\ZZ_p</m>-modules and a certain category of
        finite modules over the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>A[(q-1)^{-1}]</m>, in which the continuous action of the monoid <m>\ZZ_p \setminus \{0\}</m>
        on <m>A</m> characterized by <m>\gamma(q) = q^\gamma</m> is extended to the module. 
        The elements of the <m>p</m>-adic completion can be viewed as formal Laurent series in <m>q-1</m> with coefficients in <m>\ZZ_p</m>;
        it was later shown by Cherbonnier and Colmez
        <xref ref="bib-Cherbonnier-Colmez"/> that the base ring can be shrunk down to the subring consisting of 
        Laurent series whose negative tails converge on some region (see also <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring <m>A</m> itself is the base ring of the theory of <term>Wach modules</term> <xref ref="bib-Wach"/>, <xref ref="bib-Berger-limites"/>; the <m>(\varphi, \Gamma)</m>-module associated to a Galois representation
        descends to a Wach module if and only if the representation is <term>crystalline</term> in Fontaine's sense. Similar considerations apply if we enlarge <m>A</m> by replacing <m>\ZZ_p</m> with an unramified extension <m>\frako_K</m>,
        where now the Galois group in question is that of <m>K</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-Breuil-Kisin-prism">
      <title>Breuil-Kisin cohomology</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>K/\QQ_p</m> be a finite extension. Let <m>\pi</m> be a uniformizer of <m>K</m>. Let <m>W \subseteq \frako_K</m> be the maximal unramified subring
        (i.e., the ring <m>W(k)</m> where <m>k</m> is the residue field of <m>\frako_K</m>). Take <m>A = W \llbracket u \rrbracket</m> with the <m>\delta</m>-structure extending the canonical one on <m>W</m> for which <m>\phi(u) = u^p</m>.
        Take <m>d</m> to be a generator of the kernel of the map <m>A \to \frako_K</m> taking <m>u</m> to <m>\pi</m>; by projecting along the map <m>u \mapsto 0</m> as in <xref ref="exa-q-de-Rham-prism"/>,
        we see that <m>d</m> is distinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring <m>A</m> is the base ring of the theory of <term>Breuil-Kisin modules</term> (<xref ref="bib-Kisin"/>), which provides an alternative to Wach modules that can be used to classify crystalline representations
        of the Galois group of a <em>ramified</em> extension of <m>\QQ_p</m>. See <xref ref="bib-Cais-Liu"/> for more on the parallel between the two constructions.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-Ainf-prism">
      <title><m>\Ainf</m>-cohomology</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the <m>(p, q-1)</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[q^{p^{-\infty}}]</m>.
        By <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>, we have an isomorphism <m>A \cong W(R)</m>
        where <m>R</m> is the <m>(q-1)</m>-adic completion of the coperfection of <m>\FF_p[q-1]</m>.
        In particular, <m>A</m> has a unique <m>\delta</m>-ring structure, for which <m>\phi(q) = q^p</m>; note that in this case <m>\phi</m> is an automorphism.
        By <xref ref="exa-q-de-Rham-prism"/>, <m>d = [p]_q</m> is a distinguished element, as is <m>\phi^n(d)</m> for any <m>n \in \ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>K</m> be the <m>p</m>-adic completion of the <m>p</m>-cyclotomic extension <m>\QQ_p(\mu_{p^\infty})</m>.
        The ring <m>R</m> can then be identified with the perfection of <m>\frako_K/(p)</m>
        by fixing a choice of a coherent sequence <m>(\zeta_{p^n})</m> of <m>p</m>-power roots of unity and identifying <m>q</m>
        with this sequence; this identifies <m>R</m> with the <term>tilt</term> of <m>\frako_K</m>
        (see <xref ref="sec_perfect"/> for further discussion).
        In this context, the ring <m>A</m> arises in Fontaine's notation as the value of the functor <m>\Ainf</m> evaluated at the valuation ring <m>\frako_K</m>.

    <title>Properties of distinguished elements</title>
    <p>
      We collect some lemmas about distinguished elements. See also <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> for a precise characterization of
      distinguished elements in <m>W(R)</m> when <m>R</m> is a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first show that <q>distinguished elements are locally irreducible.</q>
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distiguished-times-unit">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring and choose <m>f,h \in A</m>. Then
          <m>fh</m> is distinguished if and only if <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> are both distinguished and <m>(p,f,h)</m> is the unit ideal of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>fh</m> is distinguished.
          By <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-product"/>,
          <men xml:id="eq-distinguished-times-unit-congruence">
            \delta(fh) = h^p \delta(f) + f^p \delta(h) + p \delta(h) \delta(f) \equiv h^p \delta(f) \pmod{(p,f)}.
          </men>
          If <m>fh</m> is distinguished, then <m>\delta(fh)</m> is a unit modulo <m>(p,fh)</m> and hence also modulo <m>(p,f)</m>;
          we deduce that both <m>\delta(f)</m> and <m>h</m> are invertible modulo <m>(p,f)</m>. This means that <m>f</m> is distinguished and 
          <m>(p,f,h)</m> is the unit ideal; by symmetry, <m>h</m> is also distinguished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>h</m> are both distinguished and that <m>(p,f,h)</m> is the unit ideal.
          To check that <m>(p, fh, \delta(fh))</m> is the unit ideal, we may work in the localizations at <m>(p,f)</m> and <m>(p,h)</m>; without loss of generality,
          we may then assume that <m>p,f \in \Rad(A)</m>. In this case, <m>\delta(f)</m> and <m>h</m> are both units, and so
          <xref ref="eq-distinguished-times-unit-congruence"/> implies that <m>\delta(fh)</m> is a unit modulo <m>(p,f) = (p, fh)</m>;
          hence <m>fh</m> is distinguished.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> is written in a symmetric manner, in practice 
        we will use it in the case where <m>p, f \in \Rad(A)</m>.
        We again reiterate that according to our conventions, any unit is a distinguished element.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      We now see that the property of an element being distinguished depends only on the principal ideal generated by that element.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-ideal">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring. Then an element <m>f \in A</m> is distinguished if and only if <m>p \in (p^2, f, \phi(f))</m>.
          (If <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-local, this is equivalent to <m>p \in (f, \phi(f))</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is distinguished, then <m>ap + bf + c \delta(f) = 1</m> for some <m>a,b,c \in A</m>. Since
          <m>\phi(f) - f^p = p \delta(f)</m>, we can write <m>ap^2 + bfp + c\phi(f) - cf^p = p</m>,
          yielding <m>p \in (p^2, f, \phi(f))</m>.
          Conversely, suppose that <m>p \in (p^2, f, \phi(f))</m> and (by way of contradiction) <m>(p, f, \delta(f))</m> is not the unit ideal;
          using <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-localization"/>, we may localize <m>A</m> to reduce to the case
          where <m>p,f,\delta(f) \subseteq \Rad(A)</m> (and <m>A \neq 0</m>). In this case, <m>p \in (f, \phi(f))</m>, so there exist <m>a,b \in A</m>
          such that <m>p = af + b \phi(f)</m>; that is,
          <me>
            p(1 - b \delta(f)) = af + b f^p = f(a + bf^{p-1}).
          </me>
          Since <m>p</m> is distinguished (<xref ref="exa-crystalline-prism"/>), so is <m>f</m> by two applications of <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> (one in each direction);
          this yields the desired contradiction.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>A</m> a <m>\delta</m>-ring, the property of <m>d \in A</m> being distinguished depends only on the image of <m>d</m> in <m>A/p^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is immediate from <xref ref="lem-distinguished-ideal"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <p>
      It will be convenient later to globalize the notion of an ideal generated by a distinguished element. Fortunately, the resulting condition still has a convenient characterization.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-ideal-locally-distinguished">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>p</m>-local <m>\delta</m>-ring. Let <m>I</m> be a locally principal ideal of <m>A</m> contained in <m>\Rad(A)</m>.
          Then the following conditions are equivalent.

            <li>
              <p>
                We have <m>p \in I + \phi(I)A</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                There exists a faithfully flat map <m>A \to A'</m> of <m>p</m>-local <m>\delta</m>-rings
                which is an ind-Zariski localization, such that <m>IA' = (f)</m> for some distinguished element <m>f</m> of <m>A'</m> contained in <m>\Rad(A')</m>.
              </p>
            </li>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The equivalence of (1) and (2) is a consequence of <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-localization"/> (which allows us to construct <m>A'</m> such that <m>IA'</m> is principal)
          and <xref ref="lem-distinguished-ideal"/>.
          Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture III, Corollary 1.9 or <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Lemma 3.1.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check that (1) and (2) imply <m>p \in I^p + \phi(I)A</m>, we may reduce to the case where <m>I = (f)</m> for some distinguished element <m>f</m> of <m>A</m>.
          In this case, the equation <m>\phi(f) = f^p + p\delta(f)</m> shows that <m>p \in (f^p, \phi(f))</m> because <m>\delta(f)</m> is a unit.

    <remark xml:id="rmk-prism-derived-complete">
      <p>
        <xref ref="def-prism"/> includes a condition on derived completeness that we have not yet defined.
        We insert a few remarks in order to maintain the narrative flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is classically <m>(p,I)</m>-complete, then <m>A</m> is derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete. The converse holds if <m>A</m> is <m>(p,I)</m>-adically separated;
        this will be true in particular if <m>(A,I)</m> is a bounded prism (see <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>).
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, on first reading it is safe to pretend that <xref ref="def-prism"/> requires <m>A</m> to be classically <m>(p,I)</m>-complete
        rather than derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete.
        However, when proving theorems it will be problematic to take completions due to the bad behavior of this functor in some situations
        (<xref ref="rmk-completions-behaving-badly"/>). The notion of derived completeness will help mitigate this, as will the odd definition of 
        flatness for morphisms of prisms (<xref ref="def-completely-flat"/>).

        A <m>\delta</m>-pair <m>(A, I)</m> with <m>I = (p)</m> is a prism if and only if <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and classically <m>p</m>-complete. We say that such a prism is

        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a prism. Then the ideal <m>\phi(I) A</m> is principal, and any generator of it is a distinguished element.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It will be enough to produce a single generator of <m>\phi(I) A</m>, as then <xref ref="lem-distinguished-ideal"/> 
          (which applies because <m>pA + \phi(I) \subseteq \Rad(A)</m>) will imply that any other generator
          is also distinguished.
        </p>
        <p>
          By definition, we have <m>p = a + b</m> with <m>a \in I^p, b \in \phi(I) A</m>;
          we will show that <m>b</m> generates <m>\phi(I) A</m> and is distinguished.
          Choose a faithfully flat map <m>A \to A'</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings as per <xref ref="lem-ideal-locally-distinguished"/>;
          it will suffice to show that <m>b</m> generates <m>\phi(I)A'</m> and is distinguished in <m>A'</m>.
          By construction, <m>IA'</m> is generated by a distinguished element <m>d \in A'</m>.
          Write <m>a = xd^p, b = y\phi(d)</m> for some <m>x,y \in A'</m>.
          Since <m>\phi(d)</m> is also distinguished, it will suffice to show that <m>y</m> is a unit in <m>A'</m>.
          Since <m>pA + I \subseteq \Rad(A)</m>, it will further suffice to show that <m>pA' + IA' + yA' = A'</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose the contrary; using <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-localization"/>, we may choose a further localization <m>A' \to A''</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings
          such that <m>pA'' + IA'' + yA'' \subseteq \Rad(A'')</m>. The equation <m>p = a+b = xd^p + y\phi(d)</m> yields
          <me>
            p(1 - y\delta(d)) = a + (b - py\delta(d)) = d^p(x+y) = d(d^{p-1}(x+y)).
          </me>
          Since <m>1-y\delta(d)</m> is a unit in <m>A''</m> and <m>p</m> is distinguished, we may apply <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> twice to 
          deduce that <m>d</m> is distinguished in <m>A''</m> and <m>d^{p-1}(x+y)</m> is a unit; this is impossible because <m>d \in \Rad(A'')</m>.

        Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a prism. Since <m>I</m> is an invertible <m>A</m>-module, <m>I \otimes_A A/I = I/I^2</m> is an invertible <m>A/I</m>-module,

      <p>
        The category of <m>\delta</m>-pairs is defined so that a morphism <m>(A,I) \to (B,J)</m> is a morphism <m>f: A \to B</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings such that <m>f(I) \subseteq J</m>.
        The category of prisms, denoted <m>\Prm</m>, is defined as the full subcategory of the category of <m>\delta</m>-pairs consisting of prisms.

          Let <m>(A, I) \to (B,J)</m> be a morphism in <m>\Prm</m>. Then the natural map <m>I \otimes_A B \to J</m> is an isomorphism of <m>B</m>-modules.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Since the map in question is between invertible <m>B</m>-modules, it is enough to check that it is surjective.
          Using <xref ref="lem-ideal-locally-distinguished"/>, we may reduce to the case where <m>I = (f)</m> and <m>J = (g)</m> are both principal ideals
          generated by distinguished elements.
          Then <m>f</m> is a multiple of <m>g</m> in <m>B</m>, so we may apply <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> to conclude.
