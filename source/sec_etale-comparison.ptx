        In this section, we establish the étale comparison theorem for prismatic cohomology (<xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>). 
        The strategy is to use arc-descent to reduce to a case where
        everything can be calculated explicitly; this avoids any use of analytic geometry.

    <title>The Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</title>
    <p>
      Our entire discussion up to now has involved cohomology theores of <q>coherent nature</q>, involving some sort of algebro-geometric structure sheaf.
      It is reasonable to wonder how then we can hope to say anything meaningful about étale cohomology.
      The fundamental bridge between these two words is the <term>Artin-Schreier exact sequence</term>, or in a more general form the <term>Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</term>.
      (See <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0A3J for more discussion.)

      <title>Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any scheme <m>X</m> over <m>\FF_p</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \underline{\FF}_p \to \GG_a \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} \GG_a \to 0
          </me>
          of étale sheaves on <m>X</m> is exact. More generally, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \underline{\ZZ/p^n \ZZ} \to W_n \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} W_n \to 0
          </me>
          of étale sheaves on <m>X</m> is exact (where <m>W_n</m> denotes <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors of rank <m>n</m>, viewed as a group scheme with respect to addition).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The key point is the surjectivity of <m>\phi - 1</m>.
          To check this, we may assume <m>X = \Spec A</m> is affine. It will suffice to check that for <m>x = (x_0,\dots,x_{n-1}) \in W_n(A)</m>, the morphism
          <me>
            A \to B = A[y_0,\dots,y_{n-1}]/((\varphi-1)y - x)
          </me>
          is étale (and even finite étale).
          The defining ideal is generated by some elements of the form
          <me>
            y_i^p - y_i - P(x_0,\dots,x_i,y_0,\dots,y_{i-1}) \qquad (i=0,\dots,n-1)
          </me>;
          we may thus deduce that <m>A \to B</m> is finite étale using the Jacobian criterion (the Jacobian matrix is triangular with units on the diagonal).
        </p>
      </proof>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The Artin-Schreier-Witt sequence also has a nonabelian analogue; this appears in Fontaine's theory of <term><m>(\varphi, \Gamma)</m>-modules</term>

    <title>Frobenius fixed points and coperfections</title>
    <p>
      The Artin-Schreier exact sequence leads us to the following considerations.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-frobenius-fixed-points">
      <p>
        Fix an <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra <m>B</m> and an element <m>t \in B</m>.
        Write <m>D_{\comp}(B)</m> for the <m>t</m>-complete derived category of <m>B</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>D(B[F])</m> be the <term>derived category of Frobenius <m>B</m>-modules</term>; objects in this category are pairs <m>(M, \phi)</m> where <m>M \in D(B)</m>

        with <m>M \in D_{\comp}(B)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given <m>(M, \phi) \in D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>, define <m>M^{\phi-1}</m> as the cocone of <m>\phi</m> (see <xref ref="def-mapping-cone"/>); that is,
        <me>
          M^{\phi=1} = \Cone(M \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} M)[-1] = R\Hom_{D(B[F])}((B, \phi), (M, \phi))[-1]

    <lemma xml:id="lem-phi-invariants-mod-t">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-frobenius-fixed-points"/>,
          for any <m>(N, \phi) \in D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>, the map <m>N^{\phi=1} \to (N/t)^{\phi=1}</m> is an isomorphism.
          (Here the <m>\phi</m>-structure on <m>N/t</m> is the one induced from <m>N</m> using the fact that <m>\phi(t) = t^p \in tB</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>N</m> is derived <m>t</m>-complete, then the cone <m>F</m> of <m>N \to N/t</m> is complete for the <m>t</m>-adic filtration, and the <m>\phi</m>-action
          is topologically nilpotent because <m>\phi(t) = t^p \in t^2 B</m>. From this we see that <m>F^{\phi=1} = 0</m>, proving the claim.

              The functors <m>D_{\comp}(B[F]) \to D(\FF_p)</m> given by <m>M \mapsto M^{\phi=1}</m> and <m>M \mapsto (M[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}</m> commute with sequential colimits.

              </me>,
              the natural maps
              <me>
                M^{\phi=1} \to N^{\phi=1}, \qquad (M[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1} \to (N[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}
              </me>
              are isomorphisms.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For convenience, we take colimits in the ambient category <m>D(B)</m> (in contrast to the original statement).
        </p>
        <p>
          For (1), we first verify that the two assertions are equivalent.
          Consider a diagram <m>\{(M_i, \phi_i)\}</m> in <m>D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>. Let <m>F</m> be the cone of the map from <m>\colim_i M_i</m> to its derived <m>t</m>-completion;
          note that <m>F</m> is uniquely <m>t</m>-divisible, so <m>F</m> is also the cone of the map obtained after inverting <m>t</m> on both sides.
          Now both statements of the lemma are equivalent to the vanishing of <m>F^{\phi=1}</m>, and hence to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now prove that <m>M \mapsto M^{\phi=1}</m> commutes with colimits. By <xref ref="lem-phi-invariants-mod-t"/>, this functor refactors as
          <me>
            D_{\comp}(B[F]) \stackrel{N \mapsto N/t}{\to} D(B[F]) \stackrel{\bullet^{\phi=1}}{\to} D(\FF_p)
          </me>
          and both factors commute with colimits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For (2), using (1) it suffices to check that each map <m>(M, \phi) \stackrel{\phi}{\to} (M, \phi)</m> induces an isomorphism
          upon applying either <m>\bullet^{\phi=1}</m> or <m>(\bullet[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}</m>, both of which are clear.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-valuation-ring-lens">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a lens. Then <m>V</m> is a valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is.
          In this case, the value groups of <m>V</m> and <m>V^\flat</m> are isomorphic; in particular, <m>V</m> is eudoxian if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sharp\colon V^\flat \to V</m> be the multiplicative map obtained by composing the constant lift <m>[\bullet]: V^\flat \to W(V^\flat)</m> with the quotient map <m>W(V^\flat) \to V</m>.
          It is customary to write the image of <m>x</m> under <m>\sharp</m> as <m>x^\sharp</m> rather than <m>\sharp(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>V</m> is a valuation ring. If <m>\Frac V</m> has characteristic <m>p</m>, then <m>V = V^\flat</m> and there is nothing more to check;
          we may thus assume that <m>\Frac V</m> has characteristic 0. Since <m>V</m> is an integral domain, the <m>p</m>-power map on <m>V</m> is injective;
          hence for <m>x \in V^\flat</m>, <m>x^\sharp = 0</m> if and only if <m>x = 0</m>.
          This in turn implies that <m>V^\flat</m> is an integral domain (if <m>xy = 0</m> then <m>x^\sharp y^\sharp = 0</m>)
          and that the principal ideals of <m>V^\flat</m> are totally ordered with respect to inclusion (if <m>x^\sharp</m> is divisible by <m>y^\sharp</m>, then the ratio admits a coherent sequence of <m>p</m>-power roots
          and so is itself in the image of <m>\sharp</m>). Hence <m>V^\flat</m> is a valuation ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose that <m>V^\flat</m> is a valuation ring. Again, we may assume that <m>p \neq 0</m> in <m>V</m>; since <m>V^\flat</m> is an integral domain, we may apply
          <xref ref="exer-torsion-exchange"/> to deduce that <m>V</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. Since <m>V^\flat</m> is a local ring, so are <m>W(V^\flat)</m> and its quotient <m>V</m>.
          Choose <m>\varpi \in V</m> as per <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to show that given any two nonzero elements <m>x,y \in V</m>, one is a multiple of the other.
          By dividing by powers of <m>\varpi</m> as needed, we may reduce to the case where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> have nonzero images in <m>V/\varpi</m> and hence in <m>V/p = V^\flat/d</m>.
          Since <m>V^\flat</m> is a valuation ring, after possibly swapping terms we can write <m>x = yz + pu</m> for some <m>z,u \in V</m>.
          Similarly, we can write <m>\varpi \equiv yw + pv</m> for some <m>w,v \in V</m>.
          Since <m>V</m> is classically <m>\varpi</m>-complete, <m>1 - (p/\varpi)v</m> is a unit in <m>V</m>; hence <m>\varpi</m> is divisible by <m>y</m>, as then is <m>p</m>.
          Consequently, <m>x = yz + pu</m> is also divisible by <m>y</m>, as desired.

          To prove surjectivity, we must check that every element <m>x</m> of <m>V</m> has an associate in the image of <m>V^\flat</m>.

        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-lens"/>, <m>V</m> is a valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is; it thus remains to show that if <m>V^\flat</m> is not AIC,
          then neither is <m>V</m>. We may assume that <m>V</m> has characteristic 0, as otherwise there is nothing to check.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be the integral closure of <m>V^\flat</m> in a nontrivial finite Galois extension of its fraction field with Galois group <m>G</m>.
          By <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, <m>V' = V \otimes_{W(V^\flat)} W(R)</m> is a lens with <m>V^{\prime \flat} \cong R</m> and, by <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-lens"/>, again a valuation ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          By construction, <m>G</m> acts on <m>V^{\prime \flat}</m> with fixed subring <m>V</m>. By functoriality, <m>G</m> also acts on <m>V'</m>; since <m>V'</m> is of characteristic <m>0</m>,          we can
          we can see by averaging over the group action that the fixed subring <m>V'^{G}</m> is equal to <m>V</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Artin and Dedekind lemmas in Galois theory, we see that <m>\Frac V'</m> is a finite Galois extension of <m>\Frac V</m> of degree <m>\#G \gt 1</m>. This proves
          that <m>V</m> is not AIC.

        The tilting correspondence for perfectoid fields (<xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/>) implies the converse of <xref ref="lem-aic-tilt"/>:
        if <m>V</m> is a lens and <m>V^\flat</m> is an AIC valuation ring, then so is <m>V</m>. We will recover this later as a corollary of the étale comparison theorem
        (<xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/>).

          Let <m>R \to S</m> be an arc<m>_p</m>-covering of lenses. Write <m>R</m> as the slice of a perfect prism <m>(A,I)</m> with <m>I = (d)</m> (<xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>).

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>R^\flat \to V</m> be a map to a eudoxian valuation ring, which we may assume is perfect. If <m>d</m> maps to a unit in <m>V</m>, then the map extends to
          <m>R^\flat[d^{-1}]</m>. Otherwise, we may replace <m>V</m> with its <m>d</m>-adic completion; by <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the map <m>R^\flat \to V</m> corresponds to a map
          <m>R \to V^\sharp = A \otimes_R W(V)</m> whose target is a lens and (by <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-lens"/>) a <m>p</m>-complete eudoxian valuation ring. Since <m>R \to S</m> is an arc-covering, we get an extension to a map
          <m>S \to V'</m> for some eudoxian valuation ring <m>V'</m> containing <m>V^\sharp</m>, which we may take to be <m>p</m>-complete and AIC and hence a lens (<xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>). Then
          <m>S^\flat \to V^{\prime \flat}</m> gives the desired extension.

    <title>The comparison theorem</title>

      We finally obtain the étale comparison theorem.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-etale-comparison">
      <title>Étale comparison theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism and choose a generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> (<xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>).
          Let <m>R</m> be a derived <m>p</m>-complete <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebra. Then for each positive integer <m>n</m>, there is a canonical identification
          <men xml:id="eq-etale-comparison">
            R\Gamma_{\et}(\Spec R[p^{-1}], \underline{\ZZ/p^n}) \cong (\Prism_{R/A}[d^{-1}]/p^n)^{\phi=1}
          </men>
          (in the sense of <xref ref="def-frobenius-fixed-points"/>). In particular, the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> depends only on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first observe that both sides of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> admits descent for the arc<m>p</m>-topology:
          for the left-hand side this is <xref ref="thm-arcp-descent-etale"/>,
          and for the right-hand side it follows from <xref ref="cor-fixed-points"/> and <xref ref="thm-arc-descent-lens"/>.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Corollary 8.10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Using arc<m>_p</m>-descent and the Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence (<xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/>), 
          we obtain a map (from left to right in <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/>) of the desired form.
          To check that it is an isomorphism, we may apply arc<m>_p</m>-descent again: using a v-covering as in <xref ref="exa-v-cover"/>, we may reduce to a case where
          <m>R = \prod_i R_i</m> is a product of <m>p</m>-complete AIC valuation rings (and in particular a lens, by <xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>).
          Note that by <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/>, each ring <m>R_i^\flat</m> is an AIC valuation ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, the left-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> equals <m>(\ZZ/p^n)^I</m> concentrated in degree <m>0</m>.
          As for the right-hand side, we have <m>\Prism_{R/A,\perf} \cong W(R^\flat)</m> concentrated in degree <m>0</m> (<xref ref="exa-coperfection-lens"/>).
          By <xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/>, for each <m>i \in I</m>, <m>\phi-1</m> is surjective on <m>W(R_i^\flat[d^{-1}])/p^n</m> with kernel <m>\ZZ/p^n</m>. We thus have a canonical exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to (\ZZ/p^n)^I \to W(R^\flat[d^{-1}])/p^n \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} W(R^\flat[d^{-1}])/p^n \to 0
          </me>
          which is exactly what we needed.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-etale-comparison-integral">
      <p>
        As per <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Remark 9.3, we point out that a similar method can be used to obtain a variant of <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/> 
        without inverting <m>p</m> or <m>d</m>: there is a canonical identification of étale sheaves on <m>\Spec \overline{A}</m>:
        <me>
            \underline{\ZZ/p^n} \cong (\Prism_{R/A}/p^n)^{\phi=1}
        </me>
        (so in particular the right-hand side is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>).
        The corresponding exact sequence in the proof would be
        <me>
          0 \to (\ZZ/p^n)^I \to W(R^\flat)/p^n \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} W(R^\flat)/p^n \to 0
