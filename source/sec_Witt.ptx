      We now relate the discussion of <m>\delta</m>-rings to the older construction of <term><m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors</term>.
      Our main goal is to relate this construction to perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>; this only involves
      evaluating the Witt functor on perfect rings of characteristic <m>p</m>, but to develop the theory it is easier to remember that it defines a functor
      on <em>arbitrary</em> commutative rings.

    <title><m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors via adjunction</title>
    <p>
      We introduce the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors, building upon our work with truncated Witt vectors in 
      <xref ref="subsec-truncated-Witt"/> and the adjunction between rings and <m>\delta</m>-rings. However, to make this unorthodox development
      compatible with the more standard treatment (and the big Witt vectors to follow), we must introduce a key change of coordinates.

      <p>
        As indicated in <xref ref="def-delta-ring-left-adjoint"/>, the forgetful functor <m>\Ring_\delta \to \Ring</m> admits a right adjoint <m>W</m>.
        To identify the image of a ring <m>A</m> under this functor, we use the set-theoretic identifications

        This means that each element of <m>W(A)</m> has a unique expansion <m>(y_0, y_1, \dots)</m> with each <m>y_n \in A</m>; we call the <m>y_n</m> 
        the <term><m>y</m>-coordinates</term> (or <term>Joyal coordinates</term>) of this element of <m>W(A)</m>.
        (This presentation does not directly describe the ring structure on <m>W(A)</m>; see <xref ref="rmk-plethory"/>.)

      <p>
        In <xref ref="lem-unipotent-Witt"/> below.
        we will give a second set of generators <m>x_0, x_1, \dots</m> of the polynomial ring <m>\ZZ[y_0, y_1, \dots]</m>.
        This means that each element of <m>W(A)</m> has a unique expansion <m>(x_0, x_1, \dots)</m> with each <m>x_n \in A</m>; 
        we call the <m>x_n</m> the <term><m>x</m>-coordinates</term> (or <term>Witt coordinates</term>) of this element of <m>W(A)</m>.
        In these coordinates, <m>W(A)</m> will become none other than the ring of <term><m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors</term> over <m>A</m>

    <corollary xml:id="lem-char-p-Witt-frob">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the ring <m>\ZZ\{y\}</m>, we have
          <me>
            \phi(x_n) \equiv x_n^p \pmod{p}.
          </me>
          Consequently, for <m>A</m> a ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, the map <m>\phi</m> on <m>W(A)</m> coincides with the map induced by functoriality by the Frobenius on <m>A</m>.
          (This is also true in the <m>y</m>-coordinates.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The first assertion is a consequence of the fact that <m>\phi</m> is a Frobenius lift (because <m>\ZZ\{y\}</m> is a <m>\delta</m>-ring).
          The second assertion is a direct consequence of the first, but let us spell this out for clarity as the mechanism of the argument will recur in what follows.
          For a general ring <m>A</m>, each of the elements <m>x_0, x_1, \dots \in \ZZ\{x\}</m> defines a function <m>W(A) \to A</m> which is natural in <m>A</m>.
          Similarly, every element of <m>\ZZ\{x\}</m> can be viewed as a <q>polynomial function</q> on <m>W(A)</m> valued in <m>A</m> which is again natural in <m>A</m>;
          that is, we have a map of sets <m>h\colon \ZZ\{x\} \to \Hom_{\Set}(W(A), A)</m>. This map has the property that
          <me>
            h(\phi(t))(u) = \phi(h(t)(u)) \qquad (t \in \ZZ\{x\}, u \in W(A)).
          </me>
          In the case where <m>A</m> is of characteristic <m>p</m>, we have <m>\phi(x_n) = x_n^p + p \delta(x_n)</m>
          and so  for any <m>u \in W(A)</m>,
          <md>
            <mrow>\phi(h(x_n)(u)) &amp;= h(\phi(x_n))(u) </mrow>
            <mrow>&amp;= h(x_n^p + p \delta(x_n))(u)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp;= h(x_n^p)(u) + p h(\delta(x_n))(u)</mrow> 
            <mrow>&amp;= h(x_n)(u)^p.</mrow>
          </md>
          This shows that the <m>\phi</m> acts via the functorial Frobenius.

      We record some consequences of the adjunction between <m>\Ring</m> and <m>\Ring_\delta</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The identity map in <m>\Hom_{\Ring_\delta}(W(A), W(A))</m> corresponds via adjunction to a morphism <m>W(A) \to A</m> of rings.
        In coordinates, this is the map <m>(x_0,x_1,\dots) \mapsto x_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity map in <m>\Hom_{\Ring}(W(A), W(A))</m> corresponds via adjunction to a morphism <m>\Delta\colon W(A) \to W(W(A))</m> in <m>\Ring_\delta</m>
        which is moreover functorial in <m>A</m>. This map is sometimes called the <term>diagonal</term>.

    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def-constant-lift">
      <p>
        Recall that the action of <m>\delta</m> on <m>\ZZ[y_0, y_1, \dots]</m> satisfies <m>\delta(y_n) = y_{n+1}</m>;
        consequently, if we express an element of <m>W(A)</m> in the <m>y</m>-coordinates as <m>(y_0, y_1, \dots)</m>, it 
        is <m>\delta</m>-constant if and only if <m>y_1 = y_2 = \cdots = 0</m>.
        By <xref ref="lem-unipotent-Witt"/>, in the usual coordinates, an element <m>(x_0,x_1,\dots)</m> of <m>W(A)</m>
        is <m>\delta</m>-constant if and only if <m>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, the <m>\delta</m>-constants are the image of the multiplicative (but <em>not additive</em>; see <xref ref="exer-ghost-map-multiplicative"/>) 
        section <m>[\bullet]\colon A \to W(A)</m> of the projection

    <remark xml:id="rmk-multiplicative-section">
      <p>
        The constant lift is also known as the <term>Teichmüller lift</term>.
        While this terminology is (fairly) historically accurate, 
        in light of Oswald Teichmüller's <url visual="mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Teichmuller/" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Teichmuller/">role in the Nazi Party and in denunciation of Jewish mathematicians in Germany during the 1930s</url>,

    <title>Ghost coordinates</title>
    <p>
      The description of <m>W(A)</m> we are using does not make it especially clear how the addition and multiplication operations work.
      To clarify this, we relate back to the more standard presentation of Witt vectors.

        Nonetheless, for <m>x \in W(A)</m>, it will be convenient to refer to the terms of <m>w(x) = (w_0, w_1, \dots)</m> 
        as the <term>ghost coordinates</term> of <m>x</m>. By <xref ref="cor-phi-on-ghost"/>, the ghost coordinates of <m>\phi^n(x)</m>

        <m>W(A) \stackrel{\phi^n}{\to} W(A) \to A</m> is given by <m>x \mapsto w_n</m>. That is, the ghost map is a natural transformation

        Using the ghost map, we can now see that <m>W(A)</m> agrees with the usual definition of the ring of <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors of <m>A</m>,
        in which the arithmetic operations on Witt vectors are given by certain universal polynomials in the entries of the Witt vectors.
        We may read off properties of these polynomials using functoriality; 
        this is similar to a more typical proof of the existence of the functor <m>W</m> (see for example <xref ref="bib-Jacobson-2"/>, section 8.10),
        except that now we don't need to worry about its existence! This means that we can freely pass from general rings to <m>p</m>-torsion-free rings

          Then any morphism <m>R \to S/(p)</m> lifts uniquely to a morphism <m>W(R) \to S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first use <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence2"/> to lift <m>R \to S/(p)</m> to a multiplicative map <m>R \to S</m>.
          Using the series representations from <xref ref="def-multiplicative-lift"/>, we then obtain a set-theoretic map <m>W(R) \to S</m>
          which we must show is an homomorphism; it is enough to check that it induces a homomorphism <m>W(R) \to S/p^n</m> for each <m>n</m>.
          This is not too onerous to prove by direct computation;
          see for example <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Lemma 1.1.7.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second, more conceptual approach is to apply the fact that if <m>A</m> is a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, then the cotangent complex
          <m>L_{A/\FF_p}</m> vanishes; we will revisit this comment once we have introduced the cotangent complex in <xref ref="subsec_cotangent-complex"/>.
          See <xref ref="exer-cotangent-complex-perfect"/> (and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture II, Lemma 3.5).

    <title>Beyond the perfect case in characteristic <m>p</m></title>

      It is <em>not</em> the case that <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> can be extended to relate <m>p</m>-torsion-free, <m>p</m>-adically complete
      rings whose reductions modulo <m>p</m> are not perfect with the image of the functor <m>W</m> on nonperfect rings of characteristic <m>p</m>. We record
      some assorted remarks here.

    <definition xml:id="def-perfect-adjoints">
      <p>
        The inclusion of the full subcategory of perfect rings of characteristic <m>p</m> into arbitrary rings of characteristic
        <m>p</m> has both left and right adjoints. The left adjoint maps <m>A</m> to <m>\colim_\phi A</m>, which we call the <term>coperfection</term> of <m>A</m>.
        The right adjoint maps <m>A</m> to <m>\lim_\phi A</m>, which we call the <term>perfection</term> of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The following examples show that the relationship between the perfection and coperfection can be a bit subtle.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-perfection-coperfection1">
      <p>
        For <m>A = \FF_p[x]</m>, the coperfection equals <m>\FF_p[x^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> while the perfection equals <m>\FF_p</m>.

        Let <m>A</m> be a <m>p</m>-torsion-free, <m>p</m>-adically complete <m>\delta</m>-ring.
        Let <m>R</m> be the coperfection of <m>A/(p)</m> (<xref ref="def-perfect-ring"/>). Using <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>, we obtain a morphism <m>A \to W(R)</m> in <m>\Ring_\delta</m>;
        this map is injective if <m>A/(p)</m> is reduced. If we fix <m>A</m> as an underlying ring while varying its <m>\delta</m>-ring structure,

        <xref ref="lem-char-p-Witt-frob"/> implies that when <m>A</m> is a reduced ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, the map <m>\phi</m> on <m>W(A)</m> is injective.
        By contrast, if <m>A</m> is a nonreduced ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, then <m>\phi</m> is not injective: for any nonzero <m>x \in A</m> with <m>x^p = 0</m>,
        we have <m>[x] \neq 0</m> but <m>\phi([x]) = [x^p] = 0</m>.

        If <m>A</m> is a ring not of characteristic <m>p</m>, then the map <m>\phi</m> on <m>W(A)</m> is not injective either, but this is somewhat more subtle.
        See <xref ref="exer-witt-vector-frobenius-injective"/>. (One case which is not subtle: if <m>p</m> is invertible in <m>W(A)</m>, then the ghost map is an isomorphism
        and so we may see the kernel of <m>\phi</m> on the ghost side, remembering that <m>\phi</m> acts here as the left shift.)
