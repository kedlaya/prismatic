      In this section, we describe a natural analogue of <term>derived functors</term> for categories which are not necessarily additive.
      Putting this theory in its proper level of generality involves addressing a <em>lot</em> of technicalities which we elide here.

  <subsection>
    <title>Simplicial resolutions</title>
    <p>
      To introduce this section, we start with a motivating remark.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Suppose one is trying to write down a functor <m>F</m> from <m>\Mod_A</m> to some abelian category 
        which is right exact and commutes with filtered colimits.
        Then it is enough to specify the values of <m>F</m> on arbitrary <em>finite free</em> <m>A</m>-modules: every module is a cokernel of a morphism
        between two free modules, each of which is itself a filtered colimit of finite free modules.
        Furthermore, using projective resolutions by free modules, we can compute the left derived functors of <m>F</m> from this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The construction of nonabelian derived functors allows us to do something similar starting from the category <m>\Ring_A</m>.
        The free objects in this case (i.e., the essential image of the forgetful functor to sets) are polynomial rings.
        In order to replace modules to rings, we need to reconceptualize some familiar constructions without reference to the additive structure of the category
        <m>\Mod_A</m>; for example, in <m>\Mod_A</m> we can form the equalizer of two maps <m>f_1, f_2: M \to N</m> as the kernel of the difference <m>f_1 - f_2</m>,
        but now we need to forgo this shortcut.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting process amounts to the transition from <term>homological algebra</term> to 
        <term>homotopical algebra</term> in the sense of Quillen <xref ref="bib-Quillen-homotopical"/>.
        Nowadays this is usually done in the framework of <m>\infty</m>-categories, as in <xref ref="bib-Lurie-higher-topos"/>;
        we will keep ourselves in a very limited part of the picture so as to keep the prerequities for the discussion under control.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      To build on the previous remark, we recall the definition of <term>simplicial objects</term> from <xref ref="def-simplicial-object"/>, then give a simplicial analogue
      of a <term>resolution</term> in homological algebra.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Delta</m> be the category of finite ordered sets (<xref ref="def-category-finite-ordered-sets"/>).
        Recall (from <xref ref="def-simplicial-object"/>) that for <m>\calC</m> an arbitrary category, a
        <term>simplicial object</term> of a category <m>\calC</m> is a covariant functor <m>U: \Delta^{\op} \to \calC</m>,
        while a <term>cosimplicial object</term> of a category <m>\calC</m> is a covariant functor <m>U: \Delta \to \calC</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>simplicial resolution</term> of an object <m>X \in \calC</m> is a simplicial object <m>U: \Delta^{\op} \to \calC</m>
        with colimit <m>X</m>. A <term>cosimplicial resolution</term> of <m>X</m> is a cosimplicial object <m>U: \Delta \to \calC</m>
        with limit <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let us see how the previous construction, specialized to the case of modules over a ring, gives resolutions in the homological sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      We describe a trivial example which is not quite so trivial after all.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For any object <m>X \in \calC</m>, the simplicial object <m>U</m> with <m>U([n]) = X</m> for all <m>n</m>, is a resolution of <m>X</m>.
        We call this the <term>trivial resolution</term> of <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-trivial-resolution-modules">
      <p>
        Take <m>\calC = \Mod_A</m> with <m>A \in \Ring</m>. Then the trivial resolution of <m>M</m> has associated complex
        <me>
          \cdots M \stackrel{0}{\to} M \stackrel{1}{\to} M \stackrel{0}{\to} M
        </me>
        which is homotopy equivalent to <m>M[0]</m>.
        Compare this to the proof of <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-simplicial-homological-resolution">
      <p>
        Take <m>\calC = \Mod_A</m> for some <m>A \in \Ring</m>.
        Let <m>U</m> be a cosimplicial resolution of <m>M \in \calC</m>. Then the associated complex <m>U([\bullet])</m> (<xref ref="def-simplicial-object"/>)
        is a resolution of <m>M</m>; that is, <m>M[0] \to U([\bullet])</m> is a quasi-isomorphism.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      When working with resolutions, we would like to be able to compare these, in the same way that we can show that any two injective/projective resolutions
      of an object of <m>\Mod_A</m> are homotopy equivalent. Here is the key definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-homotopy-equivalence">
      <p>
        Suppose that the category <m>\calC</m> has finite coproducts. Let <m>U,V</m> be simplicial objects of <m>\calC</m> and let <m>a,b: U \to V</m> be two morphisms.
        A <term>homotopy</term> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> is a morphism <m>h: U \times \Delta([1]) \to V</m> such that <m>a = h \circ e_0</m> and <m>b = h \circ e_1</m>.
        We say that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <term>homotopic</term> if they belong to the same equivalence class under the equivalence relation generated by homotopies.
        We say that a single morphism <m>a: U \to V</m> is a <term>homotopy equivalence</term> if there exists a second morphism <m>b: V \to U</m>
        such that <m>b \circ a</m> is homotopic to <m>\id_U</m> and <m>a \circ b</m> is homotopic to <m>\id_V</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        Take <m>\calC = \Mod_A</m> with <m>A \in \Ring</m>. Then a homotopy between morphisms <m>a,b: U \to V</m> of simplicial objects gives rise to a homotopy
        of the corresponding complexes in <m>\Comp(A)</m>. In particular, if two simplicial objects <m>U,V</m> are homotopy equivalent, then the corresponding objects in <m>K(A)</m> are isomorphic.
        For a converse to this assertion, see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 01A1.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Just as in homological algebra, one would like to work in the derived category to enforce that any object is <q>interchangeable</q> with a sufficiently nice resolution,
        in the simplicial realm one wants to to replace objects with simplicial objects that are more flexible (in the sense of being <term>fibrant</term> or <term>cofibrant</term>).
        The general story is out of scope for these notes (in part due to the need to develop robust combinatorial formalism, as in the language of <m>\infty</m>-categories,
        to keep track of homotopy coherence);
        here we limit ourselves to a few critical examples, such as <xref ref="exa-derived-tensor-product"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-derived-tensor-product">
      <p>
        Let <m>A \to B</m> be a morphism in <m>\Ring</m>. Choose a simplicial resolution <m>U</m> of <m>B</m> by free <m>A</m>-algebras
        (e.g., the standard resolution; see <xref ref="exa-standard-resolution-rings"/>.
        Then for any morphism <m>A \to C</m> of rings, we may define the <term>simplicial tensor product</term> <m>B \otimes_A C</m> to be the simplicial ring
        <m>U \otimes_A C</m>; any two choices of <m>U</m> will give rise to homotopy equivalent objects. 
        Similarly, we may define the simplicial tensor product of two simplicial <m>A</m>-algebras.

    <remark>
      <p>
        It should be stressed that while the standard resolution is a <q>natural</q> (and functorial) way to construct simplicial resolutions, the resulting resolutions are
        not <em>preferred</em> in any mathematical sense. In particular, if one starts performing operations one quickly ends up with simplicial resolutions that are not
        the standard ones but are homotopy equivalent, and the distinction will carry no value (if anything it is more of a hindrance).

    <title>Nonabelian derived functors</title>
    <p>
      We now ready to define an analogue of derived functors for algebras over a given ring. For this, the following definition will be useful.

        Given covariant functors <m>F: \calC_1 \to \calC_2, G: \calC_1 \to \calC_3</m>, the <term>left Kan extension</term> of <m>G</m> along <m>F</m> consists of a covariant functor
        <m>L: \calC_2 \to \calC_3</m> and a natural transformation <m>\alpha: G \to L \circ F</m> which are universal for this property: that is,
        if <m>M: \calC_2 \to \calC_3</m> is another functor and <m>\beta: G \to M \circ F</m>, then there is a unique natural transformation <m>\sigma: L \to M</m>
        making the second diagram in <xref ref="fig-left-Kan-extension"/> commute. As usual with a definition via a universal property, the use of the definite
        article is justified by the observation that any two objects satisfying the definition are uniquely isomorphic.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-cotangent-complex-of-completion">
      <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>A \in \Ring</m> be classically <m>p</m>-complete with bounded <m>p</m>-power torsion. Let <m>B \in \Ring_A</m> be flat (so that <m>B</m> also has bounded <m>p</m>-power torsion).
         Let <m>\widehat{B}</m> be the classical <m>p</m>-completion of <m>B</m>. 
         Then the derived <m>p</m>-completion of the cotangent complex of <m>B \to \widehat{B}</m> is zero
         in <m>D(\widehat{B})</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          The complex in question vanishes after applying <m>\otimes_{\ZZ}^L \ZZ/p</m> by the base change formula (<xref ref="prop-cotangent-complex"/>), and then
          derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>) yields the claim.
