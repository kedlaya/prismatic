      In this section, we discuss how to adapt our previous statements about smooth algebras to the singular case. The idea is to use
      simplicial resolutions of singular algebras by smooth ones, so that all the heavy lifting gets done by the smooth case.

    <title>Derived prismatic cohomology</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a bounded prism with slice <m>\overline{A}</m>.
        The <term>derived prismatic cohomology</term> functor <m>L\Prism_{\bullet/A}: \Ring_{\overline{A}} \to D_{\comp}(A)</m>
        is the left derived functor of the functor <m>\Poly_{\overline{A}} \to D_{\comp}(A)</m> given by <m>R_0 \mapsto \Prism_{\widehat{R_0}/A}</m>
        (where <m>\widehat{R_0}</m> is the derived <m>p</m>-completion).
        Note that <m>L\Prism_{R/A}</m> is a commutative algebra object in <m>D_{\comp}(A)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the <term>derived Hodge-Tate cohomology</term> functor <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{\bullet/A}: \Ring_{\overline{A}} \to D_{\comp}(\overline{A})</m>
        is the left derived functor of the functor <m>\Poly_{\overline{A}} \to D_{\comp}(A)</m> given by <m>R_0 \mapsto \overline{\Prism}_{\widehat{R_0}/A}</m>.
        Note that <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m> is a commutative algebra object in <m>D_{\comp}(R)</m>.
        There is a natural isomorphism <m>L\Prism_{R/A} \otimes_A^L \overline{A} \cong L \overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m> in <m>D_{\comp}(\overline{A})</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-delta-structure-on-prismatic-cohomology">
      <p>
        The object <m>L\Prism_{R/A}</m> admits a <m>\phi_A</m>-semilinear endomorphism <m>\phi_R</m>.
        One can further show that <m>L\Prism_{R/A}</m> carries the structure of a <term>derived <m>\delta</m>-ring</term> once one makes a precise definition of this concept
        (which we will not do here).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While ordinary prismatic and Hodge-Tate cohomology are concentrated in nonnegative degrees, the same is not true of derived prismatic and Hodge-Tate cohomology.
        In general, they will not even be bounded below!

    <proposition xml:id="prop-derived-Hodge-Tate-comparison">
      <title>Derived Hodge-Tate comparison</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a bounded prism. For any <m>R \in \Ring_{\overline{A}}</m>, the complex <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m> admits a functorial (in <m>R</m>)
          multiplicative exhaustive increasing filtration <m>\Fil_\bullet^{\HT}</m> in <m>D_{\comp}(R)</m> for which we have canonical identifications
          <me>
            \gr_i^{\HT}(L\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}) \cong \left(\bigwedge^i_{\overline{A}} L_{R/\overline{A}}\{-i\}\right)[-i]^\wedge_{(p)}
          </me>
          where <m>\{-i\}</m> denotes a Breuil-Kisin twist (<xref ref="def-Breuil-Kisin-twist"/>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This follows from the same argument as in <xref ref="prop-derived-Cartier-isomorphism"/> upon checking that when <m>R</m> is the <m>p</m>-adic 
          completion of a polynomial ring over <m>A</m>, we have <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \cong \overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m>;
          this amounts to an application of <xref ref="lem-cotangent-complex-of-completion"/>.

    <corollary>
      <title>Comparison with the smooth case</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a bounded prism. For any <m>p</m>-completely smooth <m>A/I</m>-algebra, the natural map <m>L\Prism_{R/A} \to \Prism_{R/A}</m>
          is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This follows from <xref ref="prop-derived-Hodge-Tate-comparison"/> as in the proof of <xref ref="cor-compare-deRham-smooth"/>.

    <title>Regular semilenses</title>
    <p>
      The statement that derived de Rham cohomology can be computed easily using regular semiperfect rings (<xref ref="rmk-de-Rham-via-derived"/>) can be adapted as follows.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-semilens">
      <p>
        Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism.
        A <term>semilens</term> over <m>\overline{A}</m> is a derived <m>p</m>-complete ring which can be written as the quotient of some lens over <m>\overline{A}</m>.
        (This corresponds to a <term>semiperfectoid ring</term> in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/> and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.)
        If <m>S</m> is a semilens, then <m>S/p</m> is semiperfect and <m>\theta: W(S^\flat) \to S</m> is surjective.
        It will follow from <xref ref="rmk-regular-semilens-cohomology"/> that <m>L\Prism_{S/A} \in D^{\leq 0}(A)</m>,
        but in general it will not be concentrated in degree 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>(A,I)</m> a perfect prism, a <term>regular semilens</term> over <m>(A, I)</m> is a ring <m>S</m> of the form 
        <m>R/J</m> where <m>R</m> is a lens over <m>\overline{A}</m> and <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> generated by a regular sequence.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-regular-semilens-cohomology">
      <p>
        Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism and let <m>S</m> be a regular semilens over <m>(A,I)</m>.
        For simplicity, assume also that <m>\overline{A}</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and <m>S</m> is <m>p</m>-completely flat over <m>\overline{A}</m>.
        From <xref ref="prop-derived-Hodge-Tate-comparison"/>, we see that <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{S/A}</m> admits an increasing exhaustive filtration
        with graded pieces <m>\left(\bigwedge^i L_{S/\overline{A}}\{-i\}\right)[-i]</m>. By our assumptions on <m>S</m>, each of these graded pieces is a finite projective <m>S</m>-module
        (compare the proof of <xref ref="lem-regular-semiperfect-de-Rham"/>). It follows that <m>L\overline{\Prism}_{S/A}</m> is concentrated in degree 0,
        where it is a <m>p</m>-completely flat <m>S</m>-algebra; consequently, <m>L\Prism_{S/A}</m> is concentrated in degree 0, where it is
        a <m>(p,I)</m>-completely flat <m>A</m>-algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also be shown (as in <xref ref="rmk-delta-structure-on-prismatic-cohomology"/>) that the Frobenius on prismatic cohomology provides <m>L\Prism_{S/A}</m>
        with a <m>\delta</m>-ring structure, so <m>(L\Prism_{S/A}, I)</m> is in fact a prism over <m>(A,I)</m>!
        This can even be made explicit: if we write <m>S = R/J</m> with <m>R</m> a lens and <m>J</m> generated by a regular sequence, then
        <me>
          L\Prism_{S/A} \cong W(R^\flat)\{J/d \}^\wedge_{(p)}
        </me>
        (compare <xref ref="lem-crystalline-weakly-final"/>).
