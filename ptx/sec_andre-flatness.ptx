      We continue our treatment of coperfections in mixed characteristic, and give some important applications in commutative algebra.
      These go through the <term>André flatness lemma</term>, whose earliest proofs <xref ref="bib-Andre"/>, <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-DSC"/> 
      depended heavily on the theory of perfectoid spaces; we incur no such dependence here.
      (More precisely, we make the argument entirely in the world of rings and schemes, with no recourse to nonarchimedean analytic geometry.)
