        In addition to the references given in <xref ref="sec_delta-rings"/>, see <xref ref="bib-Borger-course"/> for the perspective of <m>\lambda</m>-rings,

      We now relate the discussion of <m>\delta</m>-rings to older notions, including the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors, the big Witt vectors, and the theory
      of <m>\lambda</m>-rings. Relatively little of this is needed for the study of prismatic cohomology (mostly just <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>),
      but we prefer to provide a broader context with an eye towards potential future developments.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Witt-vectors">
    <title><m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors: first steps</title>
    <p>
      We introduce the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors, building upon our work with truncated Witt vectors in 
      <xref ref="subsec-truncated-Witt"/> and the adjunction between rings and <m>\delta</m>-rings. However, to make this unorthodox development
      compatible with the more standard treatment (and the big Witt vectors to follow), we must introduce a key change of coordinates.

      <p>
        As indicated in <xref ref="def-delta-ring-left-adjoint"/>, the forgetful functor <m>\Ring_\delta \to \Ring</m> admits a right adjoint <m>W</m>.
        To identify the image of a ring <m>A</m> under this functor, we use the set-theoretic identifications

          <mrow>     &amp;= A \times A \times \cdots.</mrow>

        This means that each element of <m>W(A)</m> has a unique expansion <m>(y_0, y_1, \dots)</m> with each <m>y_n \in A</m>; we call the <m>y_n</m> 
        the <term><m>y</m>-coordinates</term> of this element of <m>W(A)</m>.
        (This presentation does not directly describe the ring structure on <m>W(A)</m>; see <xref ref="rmk-plethory"/>.)
      </p>
      <p>        
        In <xref ref="lem-unipotent-Witt"/> below.
        we will give a second set of generators <m>x_0, x_1, \dots</m> of the polynomial ring <m>\ZZ[y_0, y_1, \dots]</m>.
        This means that each element of <m>W(A)</m> has a unique expansion <m>(x_0, x_1, \dots)</m> with each <m>x_n \in A</m>; 
        we call the <m>x_n</m> the <term><m>x</m>-coordinates</term> of this element of <m>W(A)</m>.
        In these coordinates, <m>W(A)</m> will become none other than the ring of <term><m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors</term> over <m>A</m>
        via the translation described in <xref ref="def-ghost-map"/>.

      We record some consequences of the adjunction between <m>\Ring</m> and <m>\Ring_\delta</m>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The identity map in <m>\Hom_{\Ring_\delta}(W(A), W(A))</m> corresponds via adjunction to a morphism <m>W(A) \to A</m> of rings.
        In coordinates, this is the map <m>(x_0,x_1,\dots) \mapsto x_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity map in <m>\Hom_{\Ring}(W(A), W(A))</m> corresponds via adjunction to a morphism <m>\Delta: W(A) \to W(W(A))</m> in <m>\Ring_\delta</m>
        which is moreover functorial in <m>A</m>. This map is sometimes called the <term>diagonal</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def-constant-lift">
      <p>
        Recall that the action of <m>\delta</m> on <m>\ZZ[y_0, y_1, \dots]</m> satisfies <m>\delta(y_n) = y_{n+1}</m>;
        consequently, if we express an element of <m>W(A)</m> in the <m>y</m>-coordinates as <m>(y_0, y_1, \dots)</m>, it 
        is <m>\delta</m>-constant if and only if <m>y_1 = y_2 = \cdots = 0</m>.
        By <xref ref="lem-unipotent-Witt"/>, in the usual coordinates, an element <m>(x_0,x_1,\dots)</m> of <m>W(A)</m>
        is <m>\delta</m>-constant if and only if <m>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, the <m>\delta</m>-constants are the image of the multiplicative (but <em>not additive</em>) section <m>[\bullet]: A \to W(A)</m> of the projection
        <m>W(A) \to A</m> given by <m>[x] = (x, 0, 0, \dots)</m>. 
        We call <m>[x]</m> the <term>constant lift</term> (or the <term>multiplicative lift</term>) of <m>x \in A</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-multiplicative-section">
      <p>
        The constant lift is also known as the <term>Teichmüller lift</term>.
        While this terminology is (fairly) historically accurate, 
        in light of Oswald Teichmüller's <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Teichmuller/">role in the Nazi Party and in denunciation of Jewish mathematicians in Germany during the 1930s</url>,
        I prefer to use a non-eponymous terminology in this instance.

    <title>Ghost coordinates</title>
    <p>
      The description of <m>W(A)</m> we are using does not make it especially clear how the addition and multiplication operations work.
      To clarify this, we relate back to the more standard presentation of Witt vectors.

        which we call the <term>ghost map</term>.

        nor surjective (unless <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-divisible).
        Nonetheless, for <m>x \in W(A)</m>, it will be convenient to refer to the terms of <m>w(x) = (w_0, w_1, \dots)</m>

        Now recall the map <m>x \mapsto w_0 = x_0</m> is the homomorphism <m>W(A) \to A</m> obtained by adjunction. It follows that the map
        <m>W(A) \stackrel{\phi^n}{\to} W(A) \to A</m> is given by <m>x \mapsto w_n</m>. That is, the ghost map is a natural transformation

        Using the ghost map, we can now see that <m>W(A)</m> agrees with the usual definition of the ring of <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors of <m>A</m>,
        in which the arithmetic operations on Witt vectors are given by certain universal polynomials in the entries of the Witt vectors.
        We may read off properties of these polynomials using functoriality; 
        this is similar to a more typical proof of the existence of the functor <m>W</m> (see for example <xref ref="bib-Jacobson-2"/>, section 8.10),
        except that now we don't need to worry about its existence! This means that we can freely pass from general rings to <m>p</m>-torsion-free rings

            </li>
          </ol>
          The functor from (1) to (2) is the forgetful functor; the functor from (2) to (3) is <m>A \mapsto A/pA</m>;
          the functor from (3) to (1) is <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The composition from (3) to (1) to (2) to (3) is an equivalence by <xref ref="lem-witt-vectors-perfect-ring"/>.
          In particular, the functor from (2) to (3) is essentially surjective. It will suffice to check that the composition from (3) to (1) to (2)
          is also essentially surjective, as then (2) and (3) will be equivalent and we can use <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>
          and <xref ref="lem-char-p-Witt-frob"/> to add (1) to the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now let <m>A</m> be a ring as in (2). Using <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence2"/>, we may first see that the map <m>A \to A/(p)</m> has a unique
          multiplicative section <m>[\bullet]</m>, and then that every element has a unique representation as in <xref ref="def-multiplicative-lift"/>.
          This gives us a bijection <m>A \to W(A)</m> of sets by matching up these presentations, which induces an isomorphism modulo <m>p</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One then needs to check by induction on <m>n</m> that the induced map modulo <m>p^n</m> is also an isomorphism for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
          This is not too onerous to prove by direct computation;
          see for example <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Theorem 1.1.8.
          A second, more conceptual approach is to apply the fact that if <m>A</m> is a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, then the cotangent complex
          <m>L_{A/\FF_p}</m> vanisehs: Frobenius acts on it both as an isomorphism (trivially) and as zero (by computation on polynomial algebras).

        We started our description of the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vector functor with the fact that the underlying functor to sets is represented by the ring
        <m>A = \ZZ\{y\}</m>. If we had needed to describe the whole functor this way, we would have needed structures on <m>A</m> giving rise to the
        addition and multiplication maps. These structures are:
        <ul>
          <li>

              a <term>coaddition</term> morphism <m>\Delta^+: A \to A \otimes_{\ZZ} A</m>; and

      <proof>
        <p>
          It suffices to produce a biring structure on <m>\ZZ[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m> representing the desired functor.
          To begin with, since the ghost map is an isomorphism whenever <m>A</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-algebra, we obtain a biring structure on
          <m>\QQ[w_0,w_1,\dots] = \QQ[x_0, x_1,\dots]</m>.
          It suffices to check that for each prime <m>p</m>, this biring structure descends to <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m>;
          this will imply that the coaddition and comultiplication maps act on <m>\bigcap_p \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots] = \ZZ[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define the family of elements <m>y_n</m> of <m>\QQ[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m> as follows: for each positive integer <m>m</m> coprime to <m>p</m>
          and each nonnegative integer <m>i</m>,
          <me>
            w_{mp^i} = \sum_{j=0}^i p^j y_{mp^j}^{p^{i-j}}.
          </me>
          By a calculation which we omit (see <xref ref="exer-big-Witt-basis"/>), we see that <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[y_1,y_2,\dots] = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m>.
          In the <m>y</m>-coordinates,
          <m>\WW(A)</m> splits into a collection of copies of <m>W(A)</m> indexed by positive integers coprime to <m>p</m>;
          hence we obtain a biring structure on <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[y_1,y_2,\dots] = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m> as needed.

        The category of <m>\lambda</m>-rings admits all limits and colimits (either by direct calculation, or using the interpretation from <xref ref="bib-Borger-Wieland"/>).
        Consequently, the forgetful functor from <m>\lambda</m>-rings to rings admits a left adjoint; as in <xref ref="def-delta-ring-left-adjoint"/>,
        the value of the left adjoint on the free polynomial ring <m>\ZZ[S]</m> is the <term>free <m>\lambda</m>-ring</term> on <m>S</m>. (The free <m>\lambda</m>-ring
        on a single element is the <m>\lambda</m>-ring of symmetric polynomials over <m>\ZZ</m>.)

      <p>
        Circling back to the original interpretation of a <m>\delta</m>-ring as a ring in which one can <q>differentiate with respect to <m>p</m></q>,
        one can think of a <m>\lambda</m>-ring as a ring equipped with descent data from <m>\Spec \ZZ</m> to something <q>below</q>.
        That putative object shares some of the expected characteristics of a mythical object called the <term>field with one element</term>;
        another (nonmythical) object that does likewise is the <term>sphere spectrum</term> in algebraic topology.
