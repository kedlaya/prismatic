      We deduce a strong form of the <term>almost purity theorem</term>.
      The statement combines the perfectoid almost purity theorems of Scholze <xref ref="bib-Scholze-perfectoid1"/> and Kedlaya-Liu <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-Liu"/>
      (which extend the original almost purity theorem of Faltings) with André's perfectoid Abhyankar lemma <xref ref="bib-Andre1"/>.

        To clarify a potential apparent ambiguity in the statement of <xref ref="thm-almost-purity1"/>,
        we point out that for a ring homomorphism <m>R \to S</m> such that <m>S</m> is finitely generated as an <m>R</m>-module, <m>S</m> is finitely presented as an <m>R</m>-module
        if and only if <m>S</m> is finitely presented as an <m>R</m>-algebra (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0D46).

          Let <m>J</m> be a finitely generated ideal of a lens <m>R</m>. 
          Let <m>S</m> be a finitely presented and module-finite <m>R</m>-algebra such that <m>\Spec(S) \to \Spec(R)</m> is finite étale away from <m>V(J)</m>.

              We have <m>J_{\lens} H^i(S_{\lens}) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.

              For every <m>n \gt 0</m>, the morphism <m>R/p^n \to H^0(S_{\lens})/p^n</m> is almost finite projective and almost unramified with respect to the context <m>(R/p^n, J_{\lens,n})</m>.

              Suppose that <m>S</m> admits an action of a finite group <m>G</m> such that <m>\Spec(S) \to \Spec(R)</m> is a <m>G</m>-Galois cover outside <m>V(J)</m>.
              Then <m>R \to H^0(S_{\lens})</m> is a <m>J</m>-almost <m>G</m>-Galois extension.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>S</m> admits an action by a finite group <m>G</m> such that <m>R \to S</m> is a <m>J</m>-almost <m>G</m>-Galois cover.
          It will then suffice to check that <m>R \to S_{\lens}</m> is a <m>J</m>-almost <m>G</m>-Galois cover. By <xref ref="thm-andre-flatness-strong"/>, we may assume that <m>R</m> is absolutely integrally closed.
          We can then find generators <m>f_1,\dots,f_r</m> of <m>J</m> such that <m>R \to S</m> splits outside <m>V(f_i)</m> for <m>i=1,\dots,r</m>. Since being a <m>J</m>-almost isomorphism is equivalent
          to being an <m>(f_i)</m>-almost isomorphism for <m>i=1,\dots,r</m>, we may reduce to the case where <m>J = (f)</m> and <m>R[f^{-1}] \to S[f^{-1}]</m> splits.
          By <xref ref="lem-enlarge-away-from-J"/>, we may replace <m>S</m> with the split <m>G</m>-torsor, for which the claims are all evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume next that <m>R \to S</m> has constant degree <m>r</m> outside <m>V(J)</m>. By <xref ref="lem-Galois-closure-rings"/>, we can find an <m>S_r</m>-Galois covering of <m>\Spec(R) \setminus V(J)</m>
          which is an <m>S_{r-1}</m>-Galois covering of <m>\Spec(S) \setminus V(J)</m>. Using <xref ref="cor-almost-Galois-finite-etale"/>, we may reduce to the previous case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider the general case. In this case, <m>\Spec(R) \setminus V(J)</m> can be partitioned as a finite union <m>\sqcup_i U_i</m> of closed-open subsets, on each of which the degree of <m>\Spec(S) \to \Spec(R)</m> is constant.
          For each <m>i</m>, let <m>R_i</m> be the image of <m>R</m> in <m>H^0(U_i, \calO)</m> and let <m>R_{i,\lens}</m> be the lens coperfection of <m>R_i</m>.
          The map <m>R \to \prod_i R_{i,\lens}</m> satisfies the condition of <xref ref="lem-enlarge-away-from-J1"/>, so we may reduce to the previous case.

      It turns out that <xref ref="thm-almost-purity1"/> can be formally upgraded by first deducing a statement about lens coperfections of integral extensions of lenses,

          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism with associated lens <m>R</m>. Let <m>R \to S</m> be the derived <m>p</m>-completion of an integral map.
          Then <m>\Prism_{S/A,\perf}</m> is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>, where it is a derived <m>p</m>-complete perfect <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A</m>.
          Consequently, <m>S_{\lens}</m> is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>, where it is a lens.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By passage to filtered colimits, we may assume that <m>R \to S</m> is module-finite and finitely presented.
          By <xref ref="lem-coconnectivity-of-coperfection"/> and <xref ref="lem-coperfection-in-degree-0"/>, we know that <m>\Prism_{S/A,\perf}</m> is concentrated in degrees <m>\geq 0</m>,
          and everything will follow once we show that it is also concentrated in degrees <m>\leq 0</m>. For this, we fix a sequence <m>g_1,\dots,g_n</m> as in <xref ref="lem-stratification-factorization"/>
          and induct on <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the base case <m>n=1</m>, the map <m>R \to S_{\red}</m> is finite étale, and so <m>S_{\red}</m> is a lens. By arc-descent for lenses (<xref ref="thm-arc-descent-lens"/>),
          <m>S_{\lens} \to S_{\red,\lens}</m> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the induction step <m>n \gt 1</m>, the induction hypothesis (and arc-descent) implies that <m>(S/g_1)_{\lens}</m> is concentrated in degrees <m>\leq 0</m>;
          by <xref ref="lem-almost-connective"/>, it is enough to check that <m>S_{\lens}</m> is <m>g_1</m>-almost concentrated in degrees <m>\leq 0</m>.
          By <xref ref="rmk-stratification-factorization"/>, <m>R[g_1^{-1}] \to S_{\red}[g_1^{-1}]</m> is a finite étale covering.

        <p>
          Let <m>S'</m> be the integral closure of <m>R</m> in <m>S_{\red}[g_1^{-1}]</m>. By <xref ref="lem-enlarge-away-from-J1"/>, the map <m>S_{\lens} \to S'_{\lens}</m>
          is a <m>g_1</m>-almost isomorphism, so it will be enough to check that <m>S'_{\lens}</m> is <m>g_1</m>-almost concentrated in degrees <m>\leq 0</m>.
          But this may be deduced from <xref ref="thm-almost-purity1"/> by approximating <m>S'</m> with module-finite, finitely presented <m>R</m>-algebras.

        In connection with <xref ref="thm-cohom-dim"/>, we should mention some results of Achinger (<xref ref="bib-Achinger"/>).
        First, every connected affine scheme over <m>\FF_p</m> is a <m>K(\pi, 1)</m> space for the étale topology.
        Second, every noetherian adic affinoid space over <m>\QQ_p</m>, and every perfectoid space over <m>\QQ_p</m>, is a <m>K(\pi, 1)</m> space.
        Both of these results can be interpreted as saying that the fundamental groups of these space are so large as to <q>absorb</q> all higher homotopy groups.

          Choose a nonzero element <m>f \in R</m> such that <m>R[f^{-1}] \to S[f^{-1}]</m> is finite étale, and define the ideal <m>J = (p, f)R_2</m>.
          By <xref ref="thm-almost-purity2"/>, <m>R_2/p^n \to S_{2,\lens}/p^n</m> is almost finite étale for the context <m>(R_2/p^n, J_{\lens}/p^n)</m>.
          Consequently, <m>\alpha_2/p^n</m> is <m>(J_{\lens}/p^n)</m>-almost zero;
          in particular, it is killed by <m>(p f)^{p^{-m}} \in R_2</m> for all <m>m \ge 0</m>.
          (Note that we are using that <m>S_2</m> maps to <m>S_{2,\lens}</m> but not any closer relationship between these two objects.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose that <m>\alpha/p^n \neq 0</m> for some <m>n \geq 2</m>. By Krull's intersection theorem (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 00IP), 
          <m>pf \notin (\Ann_{R/p^n}(\alpha/p^n))^{p^m}</m> for <m>m \gg 0</m>.
          Since <m>R \to R_2</m> is <m>p</m>-completely faithfully flat, we also have <m>pf \notin (\Ann_{R_2 /p^n}(\alpha/p^n))^{p^m}</m>;
          but this contradicts the previous paragraph. This conclusion yields the desired result.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-DSC"/>, Theorem 5.4.)

        A similar argument (see <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-DSC"/>, Theorem 6.1) yields the <term>derived direct summand conjecture</term>: 
        if <m>X \to \Spec R</m> is a proper surjective morphism, then <m>R \to R\Gamma(X, \calO)</m> splits in <m>D(A_0)</m>.

        Another result that can be deduced from almost purity is a mixed-characteristic analogue of the Kunz criterion of regularity in positive characteristic (<xref ref="rmk-kunz"/>):
        a classically <m>p</m>-complete noetherian ring is regular if and only if it admits a faithfully flat morphism to some lens. See <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Iyengar-Ma"/>.

        Yet another result in this context (but which requires methods beyond the scope of these notes) is the following.
        Let <m>A</m> be an excellent noetherian integral domain. Let <m>A^+</m> be an absolute integral closure of <m>A</m>
        (that is, take the integral closure of <m>A</m> in some algebraic closure of <m>\Frac A</m>). Then for every positive integer <m>n</m>,
        the <m>A/p^n</m>-module <m>R^+/p^n</m> is Cohen-Macaulay (<xref ref="bib-Bhatt-AIC"/>, Theorem 1.1).

          We can ignore condition (3), as we may enforce it at the end by refining the stratification. To handle (1) and (2), by noetherian approximation we may reduce to the case where <m>R</m>
          is a finitely generated <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m>-algebra; in that case, see <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Lemma 10.12.
