      Given a perfect prism <m>(A, I)</m>,
      we apply prismatic cohomology to construct a <q>canonical coperfection</q> of a <m>p</m>-complete <m>A/I</m>-algebra.
      In general this will not be a true ring but rather something derived; only in certain (important) special cases will we end up with a genuine ring.
      Nonetheless, this construction is quite useful in mixed-characteristic commutative algebra, as we will see in <xref ref="sec_andre-flatness"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From now on, we will write <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> and <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m> to mean <em>derived</em> prismatic and Hodge-Tate cohomology.

  <subsection>
    <title>Coperfections in characteristic <m>p</m> revisited</title>
    <p>
      To motivate the mixed-characteristic construction, we start by reconstructing the coperfection of an <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra in a somewhat
      exotic-looking fashion.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall that for <m>R</m> an <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra, we have defined the <term>coperfection</term> of <m>R</m> as the image <m>R_{\perf}</m> of <m>R</m>
        under the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebras to arbitrary <m>\FF_p</m>-algebras.
        Concretely,
        <me>
          R_{\perf} = \colim(R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} R \stackrel{\phi}{\to} R \to \cdots).
        </me>
        Now suppose that <m>R</m> is an algebra over a perfect field <m>k</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>. Let <m>R^{(1)} \to R</m> be the relative 
        Frobenius map (<xref ref="def-relative-Frobenius"/>); then the induced map <m>(R^{(1)})_{\perf} \to R_{\perf}</m> is an isomorphism. 
        See also <xref ref="exer-universal-homeomomorphism"/>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-kunz">
      <p>
        A fundamental theorem of Kunz (see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0EC0) asserts that a noetherian <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra is regular if and only if
        its Frobenius map is flat. (As a reminder, if <m>R</m> is a finite type <m>k</m>-algebra for some perfect field <m>k</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>,
        then <m>R</m> is regular if and only if it is a smooth <m>k</m>-algebra; see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 00TQ.)
        Since flatness is preserved by colimits, we see that if <m>R</m> is a noetherian regular <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra, then <m>R \to R_{\perf}</m> is flat;
        the converse is also true (see <xref ref="exer-frob-flat"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The following can be seen as another instance of the same phenomenon that gives rise to the vanishing of the cotangent complex for a morphism
      of perfect rings in characteristic <m>p</m> (as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-maps-from-Witt-rings"/>).
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-coperfection-via-derived-dR">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>k</m> be a perfect field of characteristic <m>p</m> and choose <m>R \in \Ring_k</m>.
          Then the projection <m>\dR_{R/k} \to R</m> induces an isomorphism of
          <me>
            \dR_{R/k,\perf} = \colim(\dR_{R/k} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \dR_{R/k} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \cdots)
          </me>
          with <m>R_{\perf}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since everything is defined using the formalism of nonabelian derived functors (<xref ref="def-derived-de-Rham"/>), 
          it suffices to treat the case where <m>R</m> is a polynomial ring over <m>k</m>
          in finitely many variables. In this case, it will suffice to check that for each <m>i \gt 0</m>,
          <me>
            \colim(\Omega^i_{R/k} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \Omega^i_{R/k} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \cdots)
          </me>
          vanishes. This follows from the fact that Frobenius kills differential forms: in degree 1 we have
          <me>
            \phi_R(x\,dy) = x^p d(y^p) = px^p y^{p-1} dy = 0
          </me>
          and similarly in higher degrees.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      To get closer to the mixed-characteristic case, let us reformulate in terms of derived prismatic cohomology.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-coperfection-via-derived-prismatic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a <m>k</m>-algebra for some perfect field <m>k</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>, and let <m>(A,I)</m> be the prism <m>(W(k), p)</m>.
          Then the colimit
          <me>
            \overline{\Prism}^{\op}_{R/A,\perf} = \colim(L\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}^{\op} \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \overline{\Prism}_{R/A}^{\op} \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \cdots)^{\wedge}
          </me>
          is concentrated in degree <m>0</m>, where it coincides with <m>R_{\perf}</m> (as a <m>k</m>-algebra).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Again, we formally reduce to the case where <m>R</m> is a polynomial ring in finitely many variables.
          To deduce this from <xref ref="prop-coperfection-via-derived-dR"/>, we need to check that the map
          <me>
            \gr_i^{\HT}(\phi_R): \gr_i^{\HT}(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}) \to \gr_i^{\HT}(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A})
          </me>
          induced by the Frobenius on <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}</m> conicides with the map <m>\Omega^i_{R/k} \to \Omega^i_{R/k}</m> induced by the Frobenius on <m>R</m>
          via the identification <m>\gr_i^{\HT}(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \cong \Omega^i_{R/k}</m> of <xref ref="prop-derived-Hodge-Tate-comparison"/>
          (note that now we have reverted from derived to ordinary prismatic cohomology).
          By functoriality, it suffices to treat the case <m>R = k[x]</m>; this amounts to a direct calculation in the style of
          <xref ref="lem-ht-strictly-commutative"/>, which we leave to the reader.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture XIII, Proposition 1.6.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      We make one more change to prepare for the passage to mixed characteristic: we replace the Frobenius action on Hodge-Tate cohomology, which has no analogue
      in mixed characteristic, with the prismatic Frobenius.

          \Prism_{R/A,\perf} = \colim(\Prism_{R/A} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \Prism_{R/A} \stackrel{\phi_R}{\to} \cdots)^{\wedge}_{(p,I)} \in D_{\comp}(A)
        </me>
        (the derived completion being <m>(p,I)</m>-adic) using the <m>A</m>-linear structure on the initial term.
        This corresponds to the <term>perfection</term> in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.

      <p>
        Define the <term>lens coperfection</term> as

          R_{\lens} = \Prism_{R/A,\perf} \otimes_A^L \overline{A} \in D_{\comp}(R)
        </me>
        (the derived completion being <m>p</m>-adic) using the <m>R</m>-linear structure coming from <m>R \to \overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \to \Prism_{R/A} \otimes_A^L \overline{A}</m>
        (the latter map coming from the identification of <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> with the first term of the colimit defining <m>\Prism_{R/A,\perf}</m>).
        This corresponds to the <term>perfectoidization</term> in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By construction, <m>\Prism_{R/A,\perf}</m> and <m>R_{\lens}</m> are cocmmutative algebra objects in <m>D_{\comp}(A)</m> and <m>D_{\comp}(R)</m>, respectively.
        The Frobenius on <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> induces an automorphism of <m>\Prism_{R/A,\perf}</m> denoted <m>\phi_R</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The notation <m>R_{\lens}</m> suggests that the lens coperfection of <m>R</m> depends only on <m>R</m> and not on its description as an <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebra.
        This will be confirmed by <xref ref="lem-base-independence-of-lens-coperfection"/>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          By derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>), the first statement implies the third.
          To check the first and second statements, 
          we may reduce to comparing graded pieces of the Hodge-Tate filtration. Using <xref ref="prop-derived-Hodge-Tate-comparison"/> to translate the statement
          in terms of cotangent complexes plus <xref ref="eq-cotangent-complex-sequence"/>, we reduce to checking that the derived <m>p</m>-completion of 
          <m>L_{\overline{B}/\overline{A}}</m> vanishes. This holds because both rings are lenses; see <xref ref="exer-cotangent-complex-lens"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      Let us consider some examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Coperfection for a crystalline prism</title>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>(A,I)</m> is crystalline, that is, <m>I = (p)</m> and <m>A = W(\overline{A})</m>. 
        By <xref ref="cor-coperfection-via-derived-prismatic"/>, we have
        <me>
          R_{\lens} \cong R_{\perf}, \qquad \Prism_{R/A,\perf} \cong W(R_{\perf})
        </me>
        with everything concentrated in degree 0.
      </p>
    </example>

      <title>Coperfection for a lens</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism and suppose that <m>R \in \Ring_{\overline{A}}</m> is itself a lens.
        By <xref ref="lem-lens-coperfection-lens"/>, <m>\Prism_{R/A} \cong W(R^\flat)</m> concentrated in degree 0.
        Since Frobenius is already an automorphism on <m>W(R^\flat)</m>, it follows that <m>\Prism_{R/A,\perf} \cong W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>R_{\lens} \cong R</m>,
        both concentrated in degree 0.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Write <m>R = \overline{B}</m> for some perfect prism <m>(B,J)</m>; by <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the map <m>\overline{A} \to \overline{B}</m>
          promotes uniquely to a morphism of prisms <m>(A,I) \to (B,J)</m>. Now <m>(R \to B/J \leftarrow B)</m> is an object of <m>(R/A)_{\Prism}</m>, so we have
          a natural map <m>\Prism_{R/A} \to B = W(R^\flat)</m>. To check that this is an isomorphism, by derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>)
          it suffices to do this after applying <m>\bullet \otimes_A^L \overline{A}</m>; that is, we must check that <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \cong R</m>.
          This follows from <xref ref="lem-base-independence-of-lens-coperfection"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      We are now ready to consider a simple example where the lens coperfection is not concentrated in degree 0, although the verification of this will come later
      (see <xref ref="sec_q-deRham"/>). This should not necessarily be viewed as a bad thing, as the higher cohomology will carry some important geometric information.

        <m>\ZZ_p[q^{p^{-\infty}}]</m>. Take <m>R = \overline{A}[x^{\pm}]^\wedge_{(p)}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will see later (see <xref ref="sec_q-deRham"/>) that in this example <m>H^1(\Prism_{R/A,\perf})</m> and <m>H^1(R_{\lens})</m> are both nonzero.
        This will follow by our later computation of <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> using a <m>q</m>-de Rham complex (compare <xref ref="exa-hodge-tate-q-derham"/>).
        We will eventually see that <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> is given by the <m>(p, [p]_q)</m>-completion of 
        <me>
          A[x^{\pm p^{p^{-\infty}}}] \stackrel{\gamma-\id}{\to} J A[x^{\pm p^{p^{-\infty}}}]
