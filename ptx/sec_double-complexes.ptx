        A <term>double complex</term> in <m>\calA</m> consists of a collection of objects <m>K^{p,q}</m> together with morphisms <m>d_1^{p,q}: K^{p,q} \to K^{p+1,q}</m> 
        and <m>d_2^{p,q}: K^{p,q} \to K^{p,q+1}</m> such that the resulting diagram commutes and each row and column is itself a complex.

      <p>
        A double complex can itself be viewed as a complex in the category <m>\Comp(\calA)</m>. There are of course two different ways to do this, which for the moment
        are symmetric; we will have to break symmetry to discuss totalization. While this symmetry break will have some curious side effects
        (e.g., the graded commutativity of cohomology, as per <xref ref="rmk-graded-commutative-cohomology"/>), most of the statements we make asymmetrically will have
        straightforward counterparts with the orientation reversed.

      <title>Totalization</title>
      <p>
        Given a double complex <m>K^{\bullet,\bullet}</m>, the <term>associated total complex</term> (or for short the <term>totalization</term>) is the complex
        <m>\Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet})</m> with 
        <me>
          \Tot^n(K^{\bullet,\bullet}) = \bigoplus_{n=p+q} K^{p,q}
        </me>
        with differential
        <men xml:id="eq-differential-totalization">
          d^n = \sum_{n=p+q} (d_1^{p,q} + (-1)^p d_2^{p,q}).
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        More precisely, this should be called the <term>direct sum totalization</term> as distinct from the <term>direct product totalization</term>,
        in which we take the product rather than the sum. The two coincide if the original complex is bounded above in both directions, or bounded below in both directions.
        However, we will later (in <xref ref="sec_derived-prismatic"/>) have reason to consider the mixed situation, 
        in which the complex is bounded above in one direction and bounded below in the other direction, and in this case we must pay attention to this distinction.

    <title>Interchanging the rows and columns</title>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-interchange-order-double-complex">
      <p>
        Let <m>K^{\bullet,\bullet}</m> be a double complex in <m>\calA</m>. Let <m>L^{\bullet,\bullet}</m> be the <term>transposed complex</term> with
        <m>L^{p,q} = K^{p,q}</m> (and similarly for differentials). Then there are natural isomorphisms
        <me>
          \Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet})^n \cong \Tot(L^{\bullet,\bullet})^n
        </me>
        for each <m>n</m>, but we have to choose these carefully to make this an isomorphism of complexes: the identification of <m>K^{p,q} \subset \Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet})^n</m>
        with <m>L^{q,p} \subset \Tot(L^{\bullet,\bullet})^n</m> is given by multiplication by <m>(-1)^{pq}</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-tensor-product-double-complex">
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>\calA</m> is a symmetric monoidal category (e.g., <m>\Mod_A</m> using the tensor product) and let <m>K^\bullet</m> and <m>L^\bullet</m> be 
        two bounded-below complexes.
        Then <m>K^\bullet \otimes L^\bullet</m> and <m>L^\bullet \otimes K^\bullet</m> are transposed complexes of each other,
        so we may use <xref ref="rmk-interchange-order-double-complex"/> to identify their totalizations;
        in the case <m>\calA = \Mod_A</m>, both of these are quasi-isomorphic to <m>K^\bullet \otimes^L_A L^\bullet</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-graded-commutative-cohomology">
       <p>
        We can use this to explain the signs in <xref ref="lem-derived-ring-cohomology"/> as follows. 
        For <m>A \in \Ring</m>, let <m>K^\bullet</m> be a commutative <m>A</m>-algebra object in <m>D(A)</m>.
        The multiplication map can be interpreted as a map <m>\Tot(L_1^\bullet \otimes L_2^\bullet) \to L_3^\bullet</m> for some complexes
        <m>L_1, L_2, L_3</m> which are quasi-isomorphic to <m>K^\bullet</m>. (Note that we cannot necessarily take the same representative and get a genuine map
        of complexes; that is, we did not assume that <m>K^\bullet</m> is a commutative ring object at the level of complexes.) 
        Given classes <m>a \in H^n(L_1^\bullet)</m>, <m>b \in H^m(L_2^\bullet)</m>,
        we compute their product in <m>H^{m+n}(L_3^\bullet)</m> by choosing representatives of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in their respective complexes,
        taking the product, putting that into the totalization, and then applying the map to <m>L_3^{m+n}</m>. From this, it is clear that switching the order of the
        terms should introduce a sign of <m>(-1)^{mn}</m> in conformance with <xref ref="rmk-interchange-order-double-complex"/>.

    <title>The spectral sequence(s) of a double complex</title>
    <p>
      Rather than giving an axiomatic treatment of spectral sequences, we give a narrow treatment centered around a bounded-below double complex, this being the case
      of most pressing interest for prismatic cohomology. Our goal is to present the key ideas without drowning the reader in the notation needed to make everything
      completely precise.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-spectral-sequence-double-complex">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K^{\bullet,\bullet}</m> be a double complex concentrated in nonnegative degrees (in both directions). Then there exist objects
          <m>E^{p,q}_i</m> for <m>i,p,q \geq 0</m> with the following properties (where <m>E^{p,q}_i = 0</m> if <m>p,q</m> are not both nonnegative).
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have <m>E^{p,q}_0 = K^{p,q}</m> for all <m>p,q.</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each <m>i</m>, there exist maps <m>d_{(i)}^{p,q}: E_i^{p,q} \to E_i^{p+i,q+1-i}</m> such that the maps in and out of <m>E_i^{p,q}</m> compose to zero
              and the cohomology of the resulting complex there is <m>E_{i+1}^{p,q}</m>. In particular, for any given <m>p,q</m>, the terms <m>E_i^{p,q}</m> for 
              <m>i \gg 0</m> stabilize to an object we call <m>E_\infty^{p,q}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>i=0</m>, <m>d_{(i)}^{p,q}</m> equals the differential <m>(-1)^p d_2^{p,q}</m> of <m>K^{\bullet,\bullet}</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>i=1</m>, <m>d_{(i)}^{p,q}</m> is the map induced by <m>d_1^{p,q}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For <m>n \geq 0</m>, there is a filtration on <m>H^n(\Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet}))</m> whose successive quotients 
              are the objects <m>E_\infty^{p,q}</m> for <m>p+q=n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Moreover, the construction is natural in <m>K^{\bullet,\bullet}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We define a filtration on <m>\Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet})^n</m> by taking
          <me>
            \Fil^p \Tot(K^{\bullet,\bullet})^n = \bigoplus_{i+j=n,i \geq p} K^{i,j}.
          </me>
          We then construct the spectral sequence associated to this filtration as per <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 012K.
