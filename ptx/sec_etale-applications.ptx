    <title>Tilting of valuation rings</title>
    <p>
      We prove the converse of <xref ref="lem-aic-tilt"/> and recover the tilting correspondence for perfectoid fields
      (<xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/>). This theme will be continued in the treatment of almost purity (<xref ref="sec_almost-purity"/>).

    <theorem xml:id="prop-aic-tilt">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a lens. Then <m>V</m> is an AIC valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-lens"/>, <m>V</m> is a valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is; it thus remains to show that if <m>V^\flat</m> is AIC,
          then so is <m>V</m>. So suppose by way of contradiction that <m>V</m> is not AIC.
          By <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-tilt-value-group"/>, <m>V</m> and <m>V^\flat</m> have the same (algebraically closed) residue field and the same (divisible) value group.
          Consequently, any nontrivial finite Galois extension of <m>\Frac V</m> is totally wildly ramified and so has Galois group which is a <m>p</m>-group.
          This in turn implies that <m>\Frac V</m> admits a nontrivial <m>\ZZ/p\ZZ</m>-extension, and so <m>H^1_{\et}(\Spec V[p^{-1}], \underline{\FF_p}) \neq 0</m>.
          However, this contradicts <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>: the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> vanishes by 
          <xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-perfectoid-correspondence-derivation">
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> can be used to recover the tilting correspondence for perfectoid fields (<xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/>) as follows.
        Let <m>K</m> be a perfectoid field and let <m>L</m> be a completed algebraic closure of <m>K</m>.
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> implies that <m>L^\flat</m> is an algebraically closed extension of <m>K^\flat</m>, so it contains a completed algebraic closure <m>M</m> of <m>K^\flat</m>.
        Each finite subextension of <m>M</m> over <m>K^\flat</m> untilts to a finite extension of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m> which is perfectoid.
        The completed union of these extensions is an untilt of <m>M</m>, so by <xref ref="lem-aic-tilt"/> this untilt is algebraically closed.
        In particular it contains the integral closure of <m>K</m> in <m>L</m>, and so by completeness it equals <m>L</m>; in other words, <m>M = L^\flat</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>P \in K[x]</m> be an irreducible polynomial with roots <m>\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n \in L</m>. By the previous paragraph, we can find a finite Galois perfectoid extension <m>K'</m> of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m>
        and an element <m>\beta \in L</m> such that <m>|\beta-\alpha_1| &lt; |\alpha_i - \alpha_1|</m> for <m>i=2,\dots,n</m>. By Krasner's lemma, we have <m>\beta \in K'</m>; it follows that every finite extension
        of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m> is contained in a finite Galois perfectoid extension of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m>. Using the Galois correspondence, we deduce that every finite extension of <m>K</m> is the untilt of some
        finite extension of <m>K^\flat</m> within <m>L^\flat</m>, and so is perfectoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        This argument is essentially the proof of <xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/> given in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Theorem 1.5.6 except that therein, 
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> is proved by an explicit computation (<xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Lemma 1.5.4). The novelty here is that arc-descent allows us to deduce this from the much more basic
        statement that <m>V</m> can be extended to an AIC valuation ring, which is then automatically a lens (<xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>).

    <lemma xml:id="lem-rank-matrix-over-valuation-ring">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a valuation ring with fraction field <m>F</m> and residue field <m>k</m>.
          Then for any matrix <m>A</m> over <m>V</m>, the rank of <m>A</m> as a matrix over <m>F</m> is greater than or equal to the rank of <m>A</m> as a matrix over <m>k</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>r</m> be the rank of <m>A</m> as a matrix over <m>k</m>. Then there exists an <m>r \times r</m> submatrix of <m>A</m>
          whose determinant has nonzero image in <m>k</m>. This determinant also has nonzero image in <m>A</m>, and so the rank of <m>A</m> as a matrix over <m>F</m>

      <title>Semicontinuity for perfect complexes</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a valuation ring with fraction field <m>F</m> and residue field <m>k</m>. Let <m>K^\bullet</m> be a perfect complex in <m>D(V)</m>. Then for each <m>i</m>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          We may assume that <m>K^\bullet</m> is represented by a bounded complex of finite free <m>V</m>-modules. Fix bases of these modules
          and let <m>A, B</m> be the matrices representing the differentials in and out of degree <m>i</m> in these bases.
          By <xref ref="lem-rank-matrix-over-valuation-ring"/>, the rank of <m>A</m> does not increase when passing from <m>F</m> to <m>k</m>,
          and the corank of <m>B</m> does not decrease; combining these two points yields the desired inequality.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>, <m>\frako_\CC</m> is a lens; let <m>(A,I)</m> be its underlying perfect prism, choose a generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> (<xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>),
          and put <m>V = A/p = \frako_\CC^\flat</m>.
          Let <m>(W, (p))</m> be the perfect crystalline prism corresponding to <m>k</m>.
          By <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the morphism <m>\frako_\CC \to k</m> lifts to a unique morphism <m>(A,I) \to (W,(p))</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conflate the underlying spaces of the formal scheme <m>X</m> and the ordinary scheme <m>X_k</m>; on this space, we may define prismatic cohomology complexes of sheaves <m>\Prism_{X/A}</m>
          and <m>\Prism_{X_k/W}</m>. By the Hodge-Tate comparison (<xref ref="thm-hodge-tate-comparison"/>) and its compatibility with base change (<xref ref="lem-prismatic-base-change"/>), we have
          <men xml:id="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison3">
            \Prism_{X/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_A W \cong \Prism_{X_k/W}
          </men>
          (with the completion being <m>p</m>-adic).
        </p>
        <p>
          Define 
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) = R\Gamma(X, \Prism_{X/A}) \in D(A).
          </me>
          Since <m>R\Gamma(X, \bullet)</m> preserves limits, <m>R \Gamma_A(X)</m> is a derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete object of <m>D(A)</m>. By the Hodge-Tate comparison and the usual finiteness property of coherent
          cohomology on a proper scheme (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 02O5), <m>R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \frako_\CC</m> is a perfect complex of <m>\frako_\CC</m>-modules. By derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>)
          applied to suitable truncations, we deduce that <m>R \Gamma_A(X)</m> is a perfect complex of <m>A</m>-modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, <m>R \Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L V</m> is a perfect complex of <m>V</m>-modules.
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-complex-semicontinuity"/>, we obtain
          <men xml:id="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2">
            \dim_{\CC^\flat} H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat) \leq \dim_k H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L k).
          </men>
          We will deduce <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> by comparing its terms with <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first check that the right-hand sides of <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> and <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/> coincide. 
          From <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison3"/> we obtain
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) \widehat{\otimes}_A^L W \cong R \Gamma_W(X_k).
          </me>
          Reduce  modulo <m>p</m> (which gets rid of the completion) and applying the crystalline comparison theorem (<xref ref="cor-prismatic-to-crystalline"/>) yields
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L k \cong R\Gamma_W(X_k) \otimes_W^L k \cong \phi_* R\Gamma_{\dR}(X_k/k).
          </me>
          Since <m>k</m> is perfect, the Frobenius twist <m>\phi_*</m> has no effect on <m>k</m>-dimensions; we thus deduce the desired equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that the left-hand sides of <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> and <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/> satisfy
          <me>
            \dim_{\FF_p} H^i_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \leq \dim_{\CC^\flat} H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat)
          </me>
          (in fact equality will hold as perf <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture IX, Remark 5.3, but this will suffice for now).
          Apply the étale comparison theorem (<xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>) to the terms of an open affine cover of <m>X</m> to obtain an identification
          <me>
            R\Gamma_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \cong (R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat)^{\phi=1},
          </me>
          then apply <xref ref="lem-phi-invariants"/> to obtain for each <m>i</m> an injective linear map
          <me>
            H^i_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \otimes_{\FF_p} \CC^\flat \to H^i( R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat).
          </me>
          This yields the desired inequality.

          Let <m>R</m> be a lens. Then for <m>n \gt 0</m>, there are natural isomorphisms

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By arc<m>_p</m>-descent and <xref ref="exa-v-cover"/>,
          we may reduce to the case where <m>R</m> is a product of <m>p</m>-complete AIC valuation rings, and then to the case of a single such ring.
          In this case, the map <m>\phi^{-1}(d) A \stackrel{\phi/d - 1}{\to} A</m> is surjective modulo <m>p</m> (by the AIC property)
          and hence surjective by derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>R</m> is of characteristic <m>p</m>. In this case, we may take <m>d = p</m>, and then <m>\ZZ_p(n)_{\lens} \cong \left( A \stackrel{\phi-p^n}{\to} A \right)</m>.
          The map <m>\phi-p^n</m> on <m>A</m> is visibly injective, so both sides of the desired isomorphism are zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose next that <m>R</m> is of characteristic <m>0</m>. Choose a morphism <m>\ZZ_p[\mu_{p^\infty}] \to R</m>, let <m>\epsilon \in R^\flat</m>
          be the element <m>(1,\zeta_p,\zeta_{p^2},\dots)</m>, and put <m>q = \epsilon^\sharp</m>. We can then take the generator of <m>d</m> to be 
          <m>[p]_q = (q^p-1)/(q-1)</m>; we may then identify <m>\ZZ_p(n)_{\lens}</m> with <m>(q-1)^n \ZZ_p \subset \phi^{-1}(d^n) A</m>.
          This gives the desired natural isomorphism <m>\ZZ_p(n)_{\lens} \cong \ZZ_p(1)_{\lens}^{\otimes n}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To specify a natural isomorphism <m>\ZZ_p(n) \cong \ZZ_p(n)_{\lens}</m>, it now suffices to do so for <m>n=1</m>.
          In this case, we must check that the action of <m>\Gal(\QQ_p(\mu_{p^\infty}))</m> on <m>(q-1)\ZZ_p</m>
          matches the action on <m>\lim_n \mu_{p^n}</m>; this follows from the fact that

          First work out the case of a singleton complex. For this case, we can separately treat the cases where <m>\phi</m> acts by zero (where there is nothing to check)
          and where <m>\phi</m> acts bijectively. In the latter case, represent the action of <m>\phi</m> on some basis by an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>. For <m>\bv</m> the column vector
          whose entries are the generators <m>x_1,\dots,x_n</m> of the polynomial ring <m>A[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m>, the matrix equation <m>A \varphi(\bv) = \bv</m> defines
          a finite etale (by the Jacobian extension) ring map <m>A \to B</m> of degree <m>p^n</m>, which splits completely because <m>k</m> is algebraically closed.
          Use this splitting to generate <m>n</m> <m>\FF_p</m>-linearly independent elements of <m>M^{\phi=1}</m>. Finally, show that these are <m>k</m>-linearly independent
          by emulating the proof of Dedekind's lemma in Galois theory.

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a lens. Using <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison-tate-twist"/>, show that <m>\Pic(R)</m> and <m>\Pic(R[p^{-1}])</m> are both uniquely <m>p</m>-divisible.

      <hint>
        <p>
          Use <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison-tate-twist"/> to compare <m>H^i_{\et}(\Spec R, \mu_p)</m> with <m>H^i_{\et}(\Spec R[p^{-1}], \mu_p)</m> for <m>i=1,2</m>.
