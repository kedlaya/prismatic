      We introduce the framework of <term>almost commutative algebra</term> in preparation for the discussion of the <term>almost purity theorem</term> 
      in <xref ref="sec_almost-purity"/>.

    <title>A bit of motivation</title>
    <p>
      We first explain the term <term>purity</term> in this context.

    <theorem>
      <title>Zariski-Nagata purity of the branch locus</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X \to \overline{X}</m> be an open immersion of regular noetherian schemes such that <m>\overline{X} \setminus X</m> has codimension at least <m>2</m> in <m>\overline{X}</m>.
          Then every finite étale cover of <m>X</m> extends uniquely to a finite étale cover of <m>\overline{X}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

          See <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0BMB.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We next give an example where purity of the branch locus does not apply, but something <q>almost</q> as good is true.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-perfectoid-trace">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite extension of perfectoid fields (<xref ref="def-perfectoid-field"/>).
          Let <m>\frako_K, \frako_L</m> be the valuation rings of <m>K,L</m> and let <m>\frakm_K, \frakm_L</m> be the maximal ideals of <m>\frako_K, \frako_L</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        A closely related phenomenon is the fact that a ramified base change can <q>weaken</q> the ramification of a covering. A classical instance of this is Abhyankar's lemma,
        which can be used to eliminate tame ramification; see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0EXT.

    <title>A context for almost commutative algebra</title>
    <p>
      The premise of <term>almost commutative algebra</term> is that in certain situations, one would like to treat certain types of <q>small</q> modules over a ring as if they were actually zero.
      For the theory of modules over a ring, this is relatively straightforward to achieve using the notion of the quotient by a thick subcategory.
      However, we would also like to define <q>almost</q> variants of some ring-theoretic concepts,
      and this is somewhat more involved; we give only the necessary details here, restricted to the minimal level of generality sufficient for our purposes. 
      See <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/> for a more comprehensive initial development.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>context</term> (more precisely a <term>context for almost commutative algebra</term>), we will mean a pair consisting of a base ring <m>V</m> and an ideal <m>\frakm</m>
        such that <m>\frakm^2 = \frakm</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        The pair <m>(\ZZ, (1))</m> is a context for almost commutative algebra. We call this the <term>classical limit</term>, where we expect to recover concepts in
        ordinary commutative algebra.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>V</m> a nondiscrete valuation ring with maximal ideal <m>\frakm</m>, the pair <m>(V, \frakm)</m> is a context for almost commutative algebra. Since <m>\frakm</m> is a colimit of principal ideals,
        the <m>V</m>-module <m>\frakm \otimes_V \frakm</m> is flat; while adding this restriction to the definition of a context is needed for a deeper treatment
        (for instance, in <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/> it is required starting from the end of Chapter 2), we will not need it here.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m> for almost commutative algebra. A <m>V</m>-module <m>M</m> is <term>almost zero</term> if <m>\frakm M = 0</m>.
        It is straightforward to check that the subcategory of almost zero <m>V</m>-modules is a thick tensor ideal in <m>\Mod_V</m>. It thus makes sense to say that a morphism in <m>\Mod_V</m>
        is an <term>almost isomorphism</term> (i.e., its kernel and cokernel are almost zero).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m>. Choose <m>A \in \Ring_V</m> and <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>.
        The <term>module of almost elements</term> of <m>M</m> is the object 
        <me>
          M_* = \Hom_A(\frakm, M) \in \Mod_A;
        </me>
        the natural map 
        <me>
          M = \Hom_A(A,M) \to \Hom_A(\frakm, M) = M_*
        </me>
        is an almost isomorphism.
        Note that for <m>N \in \Mod_A</m> a second object, we have natural isomorphisms
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-almost-hom-elements">\Hom_{A_*}(M_*, N_*) \cong \Hom_A(M_*, N_*) \cong \Hom_A(M, N)_*</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-almost-tensor-elements">M_* \otimes_{A_*} N_* \cong M_* \otimes_A N_* \cong (M \otimes N)_*.</mrow>
        </mdn>
      </p>
      <p>
        To define the category of <term>almost <m>A</m>-modules</term>, take objects to be the objects of <m>\Mod_A</m>, with the morphisms from <m>M</m> to <m>N</m>
        being <m>\Hom_A(M, N)_*</m>. This makes sense because by <xref ref="eq-almost-tensor-elements"/>, composition defines a morphism
        <me>
          \Hom_A(M, N)_* \otimes_A \Hom_A(N, P)_* \to \Hom_A(M, P)_*.
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The category of almost <m>A</m>-modules can be identified with the localization of <m>\Mod_A</m> at the multiplicative system of almost isomorphisms.
        The easiest way to check this is not to construct the latter directly, but to check that the former satisfies the universal property that characterizes the latter: the obvious functor
        from <m>\Mod_A</m> to the category of almost <m>A</m>-modules is initial for the property that every almost isomorphism becomes a genuine isomorphism in the target.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      We now introduce some definitions which generalize from the classical limit in a perhaps unexpected manner.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m>. Choose <m>A \in \Ring_V</m> and <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>.
        We say that <m>M</m> is <term>almost finitely generated</term> if for every finitely generated ideal <m>\frakm_0 \subseteq \frakm</m>, there is a finitely generated A-submodule <m>M_0 \subseteq M</m>
        with <m>\frakm_0 M \subseteq M_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We say that <m>M</m> is <term>almost projective</term> if the functor on <m>\Mod_A</m> given by <m>N \mapsto \Hom_A(M, N)_*</m> is exact.
      </p>
      <p>
        We write <term>almost finite projective</term> as shorthand for <term>almost finitely generated and almost projective</term>.
        Note that <m>M</m> is almost finite projective if and only if for each <m>\eta \in \frakm</m>, there exist a finite free <m>A</m>-module <m>F</m>
        and a pair of morphisms <m>M \to F \to M</m> which compose to multiplication by <m>\eta</m>.
        (Compare <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/>, Proposition 2.3.10, Definition 2.4.4.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While it is true that any <m>A</m>-module which is almost isomorphic to a finitely generated <m>A</m>-module is almost finitely generated, the converse is not true.
        Moreover, an almost projective module is not projective in the category of almost modules; see <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/>, Example 2.4.5.
      </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m>. A morphism <m>A \to B</m> in <m>\Ring_V</m> is <term>almost finite étale</term>
        if <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>A</m>-module and also an almost finite projective <m>(B \otimes_A B)</m>-module via the multiplication map.
        (Note that these conditions do characterize a finite étale morphism in the classical limit, by <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0CKP.)
      </p>

    <remark xml:id="rmk-almost-faithfully-flat-descent">
      <p>
        We will use the following limited form of <q>almost faithfully flat descent</q>: if <m>A \to B</m> is an almost injective, almost finite étale morphism of rings
        and <m>A \to C</m> is another morphism of rings, then <m>A \to C</m> is almost finite étale if and only if <m>B \to B \otimes_A C</m> is.

    <title>Almost commutative algebra for lenses</title>

    <title>Almost Galois extensions of rings</title>

      Just as it is sometimes useful to study field extensions using Galois theory (see <xref ref="rmk-perfectoid-correspondence-derivation"/> for an example that we encountered recently),

              Let <m>C</m> be the fixed subring of <m>B</m> under a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>, and suppose that <m>C \to B</m> is an almost <m>H</m>-Galois extension.
              Then <m>A \to C</m> is almost finite étale.

      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove (1), we only need to check that <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>A</m>-module,
          as <xref ref="eq-almost-Galois-extension"/> already implies that <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>B \otimes_A B</m>-module.
          By <xref ref="eq-almost-Galois-extension"/>, the idempotent element of <m>\prod_{g \in G} B</m> that picks out the identity component is an almost element of
          <m>B \otimes_A B</m>. Consequently, for each <m>\eta \in \frakm</m>, we may multiply by <m>\eta</m> to get a genuine element <m>e_\eta \in B \otimes_A B</m>
          satisfying <m>e_\eta^2 = e_\eta</m> that kills the kernel of <m>\mu</m> and projects to <m>\eta \in B</m>. Write <m>e_\eta = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i \otimes b'_i</m>
          for some <m>b_i, b_i' \in B</m>; we then have <m>\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma(b_i) b_i' = 0</m> for <m>\gamma \in G \setminus \{e\}</m> and <m>\sum_{i=1}^n b_i b_i' = \eta</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define the trace map <m>t_{B/A}: B \to A</m> as the sum over <m>G</m>-conjugates. Then
          <me>
            \sum_i t_{B/A}(bb_i) b'_i = \eta b \qquad (b \in B).
          </me>
          In other words, the composition
          <me>
            B \stackrel{b \mapsto (t_{B/A}(b b_i))_i}{\longrightarrow} A^n \stackrel{(a_i) \mapsto \sum a_i b'_i}{\longrightarrow} B
          </me>
          is multiplication by <m>\eta</m>; since <m>\eta \in \frakm</m> was arbitrary, this proves that <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>A</m>-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (2), we first apply (1) to deduce that <m>C \to B</m> is almost finite étale.
          We then check that the canonical map <m>C \otimes_A B \to \prod_{G/H} B</m> is an almost isomorphism: we can check this after tensoring over <m>C</m> with <m>B</m>,

          Thus the map <m>A \to C</m> becomes almost finite étale after tensoring over <m>A</m> with <m>B</m>, and so by <xref ref="rmk-almost-faithfully-flat-descent"/>
          is itself almost finite étale.

      The construction of Galois closures of field extensions has the following analogue in this context. (One can give a version of this for almost commutative algebra,
