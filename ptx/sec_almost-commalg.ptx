      We introduce the framework of <term>almost commutative algebra</term> in preparation for the discussion of the <term>almost purity theorem</term>

    <title>A bit of motivation</title>
    <p>
      We first explain the term <term>purity</term> in this context.

    <theorem>
      <title>Zariski-Nagata purity of the branch locus</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X \to \overline{X}</m> be an open immersion of regular noetherian schemes such that <m>\overline{X} \setminus X</m> has codimension at least <m>2</m> in <m>\overline{X}</m>.
          Then every finite étale cover of <m>X</m> extends uniquely to a finite étale cover of <m>\overline{X}</m>.

    <p>
      We next give an example where purity of the branch locus does not apply, but something <q>almost</q> as good is true.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-perfectoid-trace">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite extension of perfectoid fields (<xref ref="def-perfectoid-field"/>).
          Let <m>\frako_K, \frako_L</m> be the valuation rings of <m>K,L</m> and let <m>\frakm_K, \frakm_L</m> be the maximal ideals of <m>\frako_K, \frako_L</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        A closely related phenomenon is the fact that a ramified base change can <q>weaken</q> the ramification of a covering. A classical instance of this is Abhyankar's lemma,
        which can be used to eliminate tame ramification; see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0EXT.

    <title>A context for almost commutative algebra</title>
    <p>
      The premise of <term>almost commutative algebra</term> is that in certain situations, one would like to treat certain types of <q>small</q> modules over a ring as if they were actually zero.
      For the theory of modules over a ring, this is relatively straightforward to achieve using the notion of the quotient by a thick subcategory.
      However, we would also like to define <q>almost</q> variants of some ring-theoretic concepts,
      and this is somewhat more involved; we give only the necessary details here, restricted to the minimal level of generality sufficient for our purposes. 
      See <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/> for a more comprehensive initial development.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        By a <term>context</term> (more precisely a <term>context for almost commutative algebra</term>), we will mean a pair consisting of a base ring <m>V</m> and an ideal <m>\frakm</m>
        such that <m>\frakm^2 = \frakm</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        The pair <m>(\ZZ, (1))</m> is a context for almost commutative algebra. We call this the <term>classical limit</term>, where we expect to recover concepts in
        ordinary commutative algebra.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>V</m> a nondiscrete valuation ring with maximal ideal <m>\frakm</m>, the pair <m>(V, \frakm)</m> is a context for almost commutative algebra. Since <m>\frakm</m> is a colimit of principal ideals,
        the <m>V</m>-module <m>\frakm \otimes_V \frakm</m> is flat; while adding this restriction to the definition of a context is needed for a deeper treatment
        (for instance, in <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/> it is required starting from the end of Chapter 2), we will not need it here.
      </p>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m> for almost commutative algebra. A <m>V</m>-module <m>M</m> is <term>almost zero</term> if <m>\frakm M = 0</m>.
        It is straightforward to check that the subcategory of almost zero <m>V</m>-modules is a thick tensor ideal in <m>\Mod_V</m>. It thus makes sense to say that a morphism in <m>\Mod_V</m>
        is an <term>almost isomorphism</term> (i.e., its kernel and cokernel are almost zero).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m>. Choose <m>A \in \Ring_V</m> and <m>M \in \Mod_A</m>.
        The <term>module of almost elements</term> of <m>M</m> is the object 
        <me>
          M_* = \Hom_A(\frakm, M) \in \Mod_A;
        </me>
        the natural map 
        <me>
          M = \Hom_A(A,M) \to \Hom_A(\frakm, M) = M_*
        </me>
        is an almost isomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        We say that <m>M</m> is <term>almost finitely generated</term> if for every finitely generated ideal <m>\frakm_0 \subseteq \frakm</m>, there is a finitely generated A-submodule <m>M_0 \subseteq M</m>
        with <m>\frakm_0 M \subseteq M_0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We say that <m>M</m> is <term>almost projective</term> if the functor on <m>\Mod_A</m> given by <m>N \mapsto \Hom_A(M, N)_*</m> is exact.
      </p>
      <p>
        We write <term>almost finite projective</term> as shorthand for <term>almost finitely generated and almost projective</term>.
        (Compare <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/>, Proposition 2.3.10, Definition 2.4.4.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While it is true that any <m>A</m>-module which is almost isomorphic to a finitely generated <m>A</m>-module is almost finitely generated, the converse is not true.
        Moreover, an almost projective module is not projective in the category of almost modules; see <xref ref="bib-Gabber-Ramero"/>, Example 2.4.5.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Fix a context <m>(V, \frakm)</m>. A morphism <m>A \to B</m> in <m>\Ring_V</m> is <term>almost finite étale</term>
        if <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>A</m>-module and also an almost finite projective <m>(B \otimes_A B)</m>-module via the multiplication map.

    <title>Almost commutative algebra for lenses</title>

    <title>Almost Galois extensions of rings</title>
    <p>
      Just as it is sometimes useful to study field extensions using Galois theory (see <xref ref="rmk-perfectoid-correspondence-derivation"/> for an example that we encountered recently),
      we would like to study finite étale maps of rings using Galois actions.

        Let <m>G</m> be a finite group acting <m>A</m>-linearly on the ring <m>B</m>.

              Then <m>A \to C</m> is almost finite étale.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove (1), we only need to check that <m>B</m> is an almost finite projective <m>A</m>-module.
          Define the trace map <m>t_{B/A}: B_* \to A_*</m> as the sum over <m>G</m>-conjugates.
          View <m>B</m> as a <m>(B \otimes_A B)</m>-algebra via the multiplication map <m>\mu</m>. Then <m>B_* \otimes_{A_*} B_* \to (B \otimes_A B)_*</m> is an almost isomorphism,
          so for each <m>\eta \in \frakm</m> we have an element <m>e_\eta \in B_* \otimes_{A_*} B_*</m> with <m>e_\eta^2 = \eta e_\eta</m> which kills the kernel of <m>\mu</m>
          and is mapped to <m>\eta \in B_*</m>. By writing <m>e_\eta = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i \otimes b'_i</m>, we obtain <m>\gamma(b_i)b_i' = 0</m> for <m>\gamma</m> not equal to the identity in <m>G</m>
          and <m>\sum_i b_i b_i' = \eta</m>. We thus have
          <me>
            \eta b = \sum_i t_{B/A}(bb_i) b'_i \qquad (b \in B_*).
          </me>
          In other words, the composition
          <me>
            B_* \stackrel{b \mapsto (t_{B/A}(\bullet b_i))_i}{\to} A_*^n \stackrel{(a_i) \mapsto \sum a_i b'_i}{\to} B_*
          </me>
          is multiplication by <m>\eta</m>; this proves the claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (2), we first apply (1) to deduce that <m>C \to B</m> is almost finite étale.
          We then check that the canonical map <m>C \otimes_A B \to \prod_{G/H} B</m> is an almost isomorphism: we can check this after tensoring over <m>C</m> with <m>B</m>,
          in which case we have almost isomorphisms
          <me>
            B \otimes_C (C \otimes_A B) = B \otimes_A B \to \prod_G B \to \prod_{G/H} (B \otimes_C B) = B \otimes_C \prod_{G/H} B.
          </me>
          Thus the map <m>A \to C</m> becomes almost finite étale after tensoring over <m>A</m> with <m>B</m>, and so is itself almost finite étale.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R \to S</m> be a finite étale morphism of constant rank <m>r</m>. Then there exists an <m>S_r</m>-Galois extension <m>R \to T</m> (for the classical context)
          factoring through an <m>S_{r-1}</m>-Galois extension <m>S \to T</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>\Spec T</m> be the closed-open subscheme of the <m>r</m>-fold fiber product of <m>\Spec S</m> over <m>\Spec R</m> which is the complement of all of the partial diagonals;
          this has the desired effect. (Compare <xref ref="bib-Andre1"/>, Lemma 1.9.2.)
