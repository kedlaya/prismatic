      We take a bit of a digression to relate the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vector functor to the <term>big Witt vector</term> functor and to the theory of
      <term><m>\lambda</m>-rings</term>. This is not used anywhere in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/> or <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>,
      but we prefer to provide a broader context with an eye towards potential future developments.

    <title>The big Witt vector functor</title>

      We start with some context from <xref ref="bib-Borger-Wieland"/>. See <xref ref="rmk-plethory"/> for more of the story.

        We started our description of the <m>p</m>-typical Witt vector functor with the fact that the underlying functor to sets is represented by the ring
        <m>A = \ZZ\{y\}</m>, but crucially we <em>already</em> had produced a functor valued in rings (and even in <m>\delta</m>-rings).
        If we had needed to construct from scratch a functor valued in rings, we would have needed structures on <m>A</m> giving rise to the
        addition and multiplication maps. These structures are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              a <term>coaddition</term> morphism <m>\Delta^+: A \to A \otimes_{\ZZ} A</m>; and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a <term>comultiplication</term> morphism <m>\Delta^\times: A \to A \otimes_{\ZZ} A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        A ring <m>A</m> equipped with these structures represents a functor from rings to sets equipped with two binary operations <m>+, \times</m>.
        A <term>biring</term> is a ring equipped with coaddition and comultiplication operators which are further subject to the axioms that correspond
        to the ring axioms on <m>+, \times</m>. Namely, the coaddition map is cocommutative, coassociative, and admits a counit and an antipode
        (giving rise to additive inverses); the comultiplication map is cocommutative, coassociative, codistributive over coaddition, and admits a counit.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shorter way to say this is that a biring is a commutative ring object in the category of affine schemes. (Remember that the functor <m>\Spec: \Ring \to \Sch</m> is contravariant!)

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It suffices to produce a unique biring structure on <m>\ZZ[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m> representing the desired functor.
          To begin with, since the ghost map is an isomorphism whenever <m>A</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-algebra, we obtain a biring structure on
          <m>\QQ[w_0,w_1,\dots] = \QQ[x_0, x_1,\dots]</m>; this already implies uniqueness.
          For existence, it suffices to check that for each prime <m>p</m>, this biring structure descends to <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m>;
          this will imply that the coaddition and comultiplication maps act on <m>\bigcap_p \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots] = \ZZ[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define the family of elements <m>y_n</m> of <m>\QQ[x_1, x_2, \dots]</m> as follows: for each positive integer <m>m</m> coprime to <m>p</m>
          and each nonnegative integer <m>i</m>,
          <me>
            w_{mp^i} = \sum_{j=0}^i p^j y_{mp^j}^{p^{i-j}}.
          </me>
          By a calculation which we omit (see <xref ref="exer-big-Witt-basis"/>), we see that <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[y_1,y_2,\dots] = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m>.
          In the <m>y</m>-coordinates,
          <m>\WW(A)</m> splits into a collection of copies of <m>W(A)</m> indexed by positive integers coprime to <m>p</m>;
          hence we obtain a biring structure on <m>\ZZ_{(p)}[y_1,y_2,\dots] = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1,x_2,\dots]</m> as needed.

        By analogy with <xref ref="rmk-Witt-structures-p-typical"/>, we can detect various additional structures on <m>\WW(A)</m> using the ghost map.
        We leave the details to the reader.
        (Another approach is to use the <term>splitting principle</term>; see <xref ref="exer-splitting-principle"/>.)

            For any nonempty subset <m>S</m> of the positive integers which is closed under taking divisors,
            there is a natural transformation from <m>\WW</m> to another functor <m>\WW_S</m> on <m>\Ring</m> (the <term><m>S</m>-truncated Witt vectors</term>)
            which on sets corresponds to the projection

            </me>
            (and similarly for ghost components).
            In the case where <m>S = \{1,p,p^2,\dots\}</m> for some prime <m>p</m>, this yields a projection <m>\WW(A) \to W(A)</m>.

        Another interpretation of <m>\WW(A)</m> (also due to Witt)
        can be given starting with the bijection of <m>\WW(A)</m> with <m>1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> given by
        <men xml:id="eq-Witt-series-mult">
          (x_1, x_2, \dots) \mapsto \prod_{n=1}^\infty (1 - x_n T^n)^{-1}.
        </men>
        When <m>A</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-algebra, the addition operation on <m>\WW(A)</m> imposed by the ghost map corresponds to the multiplication
        of formal power series in <m>1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket</m>. This gives us the underlying additive group on <m>\WW(A)</m>.
        One then shows that there is a <m>T</m>-adically continuous map <m>\otimes</m> which is natural in <m>A</m>, distributes over addition, and satisfies
        <men xml:id="eq-Witt-series-Frobenius-product">

      </p>
      <p>
        A more conceptual way to express <xref ref="eq-Witt-series-Frobenius-product"/> is that given two finite projective <m>A</m>-modules <m>M_1, M_2</m> equipped with <m>A</m>-linear endomorphisms <m>S_1, S_2</m>,
        <me>
          \det(1 - T S_1, M_1)^{-1} \otimes \det(1 - T S_2, M_2)^{-1} = \det(1 - T (S_1 \otimes S_2), M_1 \otimes M_2)^{-1}.
        </me>
        This point of view appears in work of Almkvist <xref ref="bib-Almkvist"/>
        and Grayson <xref ref="bib-Grayson1"/>, <xref ref="bib-Grayson"/> in the context of <m>K</m>-theory of endomorphisms.

    <definition xml:id="def-lambda-ring">
      <p>
        The interpretation from <xref ref="rmk-Almkvist-interpretation"/> leads naturally to the related notion of a <term><m>\lambda</m>-ring</term>.
        This consists of a ring <m>A</m> together with operations <m>\lambda^n: A \to A</m> for <m>n=0,1,\dots</m> satisfying various conditions.
        To begin with,
        <me>
          \lambda^0(x) = 1, \lambda^1(x) = x \quad (x \in A).
        </me>
        To state the remaining conditions, define the object
        <me>
          \Lambda(x) = (1 - \lambda_1(x) T + \lambda_2(x) T^2 - \cdots)^{-1} \in 1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket.
        </me>
        In this notation, we impose the conditions
        <md>
          <mrow>\Lambda(x + y) = \Lambda(x) \Lambda(y)</mrow>
          <mrow>\Lambda(xy) = \Lambda(x) \otimes \Lambda(y)</mrow>
          <mrow>\Lambda(\lambda^m(x)) = \wedge^m \Lambda(x)</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>\otimes</m> is the map described in <xref ref="rmk-Almkvist-interpretation"/> and <m>\wedge^m</m> is similar;
        it is the <m>T</m>-adically continuous map characterized by
        <me>
          \wedge^m \det(1 - T S, M)^{-1} = \det(1 - T (\wedge^m S), \wedge^m M)^{-1}.
        </me>
        (The last condition implies that <m>\lambda^n(1) = 0</m> for all <m>n \geq 2</m>.)
        We define in the obvious way a morphism of <m>\lambda</m>-rings (as a morphism of underlying rings which commute with the maps <m>\lambda^n</m>),
        and hence the category <m>\Ring_\lambda</m> of <m>\lambda</m>-rings.
        (One can also express the conditions on the <m>\lambda^n</m> in terms of certain operations on symmetric functions.)
      </p>
      <p>
        With this definition, we can show that there is a unique way to promote <m>\WW</m> to a functor from <m>\Ring</m> to <m>\Ring_\lambda</m>
        such that <m>\Lambda([x]) = (1-xT)^{-1}</m> for every ring <m>A</m> and every element <m>x \in A</m>.
        We omit details here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analogue of the adjunction property of the functor <m>W</m> is that <m>\WW</m> is a right adjoint of the forgetful functor from <m>\Ring_\lambda</m> to <m>\Ring</m>.
        This follows from the existence of the diagonal transformation <m>\Delta: \WW \to \WW \circ \WW</m>.

        In any <m>\lambda</m>-ring, we can define additional ring homomorphisms <m>\psi^n</m> for <m>n =0,1,\dots</m> 
        called <term>Adams operations</term>. In the case of <m>\WW(A)</m>, these are characterized by

            \psi^n \det(1 - T S, M)^{-1} = \det(1 - T S^n, M)^{-1};

        In general, the maps <m>\psi^p</m> for <m>p</m> prime form a family of pairwise commuting Frobenius lifts;
        moreover, a <m>\lambda</m>-ring is a <m>\delta</m>-ring for every prime <m>p</m>.
        Conversely (and analogously to <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift"/>), for a <m>\ZZ</m>-torsion-free ring any family of pairwise commuting Frobenius
        lifts gives rise to a unique <m>\lambda</m>-ring structure (see <xref ref="bib-Wilkerson"/>).

        By the criterion of <xref ref="rmk-Adams-operation"/>, these occur as the Adams operations for a unique <m>\lambda</m>-ring structure on <m>A</m>.

        The systematic study of plethories, which builds upon ideas from the subject of <term>universal algebra</term> (see especially <xref ref="bib-Tall-Wraith"/>),

        Circling back to the original interpretation of a <m>\delta</m>-ring as a ring in which one can <q>differentiate with respect to <m>p</m></q>,
