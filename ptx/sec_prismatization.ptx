      In this section, we survey some further developments
       which provide <term>coefficient objects</term> for prismatic cohomology.
      One approach to this is <term>prismatization</term>, introduced by Bhatt and Lurie in an as-yet-unreleased preprint; we follow the treatment of Drinfeld cited above.
      Another approach involves the <term>Cartier-Witt stack</term>.
