      We begin with the fundamental notion of a <term><m>\delta</m>-ring</term>.
      This definition was introduced by Joyal <xref ref="bib-Joyal1"/>, <xref ref="bib-Joyal2"/> with a view towards applications in <m>K</m>-theory; 
      it is closely related to the older notion of 
      a <term><m>\lambda</m>-ring</term>.
      However, this development did not gain much attention until the same idea was rediscovered by Buium <xref ref="bib-Buium1"/> 
      under the guise of <term>arithmetic differentiation</term> in the service of a particular goal (adapting Manin's proof of the finiteness of the set of torsion
      points on a hyperbolic algebraic curve embedded into its Jacobian from the function field case to the number field case)
      see <xref ref="bib-Buium2"/> for a slightly later treatment focusing specifically on arithmetic differentiation.

        Fix a prime number <m>p</m>.
        Following Joyal, we define a <term><m>\delta</m>-ring</term> to be a pair <m>(A, \delta)</m> in which <m>A</m> is a commutative (unital) ring and <m>\delta: A \to A</m>
        is a map of sets satisfying the following conditions.
        <md>
          <mrow>\delta(0) = \delta(1) = 0;</mrow>
          <mrow>\delta(xy) = x^p \delta(y) + y^p \delta(x) + p \delta(x) \delta(y);</mrow>
          <mrow>\delta(x+y) = \delta(x) + \delta(y) - \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \frac{(p-1)!}{i!(p-i)!} x^i p^{y-i}.</mrow>
        </md>
        The last condition implies that
        <me>
          p (\delta(x+y) - \delta(x) - \delta(y)) = x^p + y^p - (x+y)^p
        </me>
        and is equivalent if <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. (In some sources, a map <m>\delta</m> satisfying these conditions is called a <term><m>p</m>-derivation</term>.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The form of the previous definition is partly explained by the following construction.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a commutative ring.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>\delta: A \to A</m> is a <m>p</m>-derivation (that is, <m>(A, \delta)</m> is a <m>\delta</m>-ring).
              Then the map <m>\phi: A \to A</m> given by <m>\phi(x) = x^p + p \delta(x)</m> is a ring homomorphism that induces the Frobenius endomorphism on <m>A/pA</m>
              (a/k/a a <term>Frobenius lift</term> on <m>A</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, then this construction defines a bijection between <m>p</m>-derivations on <m>A</m> and Frobenius lifts on <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>

    <title>The category of <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>morphism</term> of <m>\delta</m>-rings <m>(A, \delta) \to (A', \delta')</m> is a morphism <m>f: A \to A'</m> of rings such that <m>f \circ \delta = \delta' \circ f</m>  (again as maps of sets only).
        It is evident that with this definition, <m>\delta</m>-rings form a category. We will often abuse notation and terminology and say that <q><m>A</m> is a <m>\delta</m>-ring</q> when it is meant to be clear from context what the map <m>\delta</m> is supposed to be.
