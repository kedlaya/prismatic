        In addition to the papers of Joyal and Buium listed below, see also <xref ref="bib-Borger-course"/> for the perspective of <m>\lambda</m>-rings,
        and <xref ref="bib-Yau"/> for a comprehensive treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have followed <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture 2, fairly closely. Some of the exercises were taken from <xref ref="bib-Borger-course"/>.

      In this section, we introduce the fundamental notion of a <term><m>\delta</m>-ring</term>.
      This definition was introduced by Joyal <xref ref="bib-Joyal1"/>, <xref ref="bib-Joyal2"/> with a view towards applications in <m>K</m>-theory; 
      it is closely related to the older notion of 
      a <term><m>\lambda</m>-ring</term>, which we will discuss briefly at the end of this section (<xref ref="subsec-big-Witt"/>).
      However, this development did not gain much attention until the same idea was rediscovered by Buium <xref ref="bib-Buium1"/> 
      under the guise of <term>arithmetic differentiation</term>.
      (Buium had the original goal of adapting Manin's proof of the finiteness of the set of torsion
      points on a hyperbolic algebraic curve embedded into its Jacobian from the function field case to the number field case;
      see <xref ref="bib-Buium2"/> for a slightly later treatment presenting arithmetic differentiation on its own terms.)

      <p>
        Following Joyal, we define a <term><m>\delta</m>-ring</term> to be a pair <m>(A, \delta)</m> in which <m>A \in \Ring</m> and <m>\delta: A \to A</m>
        is a map of sets satisfying the following conditions for all <m>x,y \in A</m>.
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-delta-ring-value-at-1">\delta(1) = 0;</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-delta-ring-product">\delta(xy) = x^p \delta(y) + y^p \delta(x) + p \delta(x) \delta(y);</mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="eq-delta-ring-sum">\delta(x+y) = \delta(x) + \delta(y) - \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \frac{(p-1)!}{i!(p-i)!} x^i y^{p-i}.</mrow>
        </mdn>
        The last condition implies that
        <me>
          p (\delta(x+y) - \delta(x) - \delta(y)) = x^p + y^p - (x+y)^p
        </me>
        and conversely if <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. (In some sources, a map <m>\delta</m> satisfying these conditions is called a <term><m>p</m>-derivation</term>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We will habitually abuse notation and terminology and say that <q><m>A</m> is a <m>\delta</m>-ring</q> when it is meant to be clear from context what the map <m>\delta</m> is supposed to be.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Note that <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-sum"/> also implies that <m>\delta(0) = 0</m>, so we don't need to include this condition separately.
        By contrast, <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-product"/> does not by itself imply that <m>\delta(1) = 0</m>; see <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-normalization"/>.

    <p>
      The form of the previous definition is partly explained by the following construction.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift">

              Suppose that <m>\delta: A \to A</m> is a <m>p</m>-derivation (that is, <m>(A, \delta)</m> is a <m>\delta</m>-ring).
              Then the map <m>\phi: A \to A</m> given by

              is a ring homomorphism that induces the Frobenius endomorphism on <m>A/pA</m>

              We will refer to <m>\phi</m> as the <term>associated Frobenius lift</term> on <m>(A, \delta)</m>.

            <p>
              If <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, then this construction defines a bijection between <m>p</m>-derivations on <m>A</m> and Frobenius lifts on <m>A</m>.

        <p>
          It was already pointed out in <xref ref="def-delta-ring"/> that <m>\delta</m> satisfies <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-sum"/> if and only if

          and conversely if <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free; while <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-product"/> implies that <m>\phi(xy) = \phi(x) \phi(y)</m>,

      <p>
        By <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-value-at-1"/> and <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-product"/>, in any <m>\delta</m>-ring <m>A</m> the elements <m>x \in A</m> for which <m>\delta(x) = 0</m> form a monoid under multiplication.
        By analogy with the case of an ordinary derivation, we call these the <term><m>\delta</m>-constant elements</term> of <m>A</m>.
        These elements also satisfy <m>\phi(x) = x^p</m>, and conversely if <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion free.

    <title>Examples of <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Using <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift"/>, it is not difficult to generate examples of <m>\delta</m>-rings. Here are a few illustrative cases.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exa-delta-ring-p-invertible">
      <p>
        If <m>p</m> is invertible in the ring <m>A</m>, then <em>every</em> endomorphism of <m>A</m> is a Frobenius lift, and thus gives rise to a <m>p</m>-derivation.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="exa-delta-ring-Z">
      <p>
        By <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift"/>, there is a unique way to equip <m>\ZZ</m> with the structure of a <m>\delta</m>-ring, namely via the map
        <men xml:id="eq-delta-on-Z">
          \delta(x) = \frac{x^p-x}{p}.
        </men>
        The <m>\delta</m>-constant elements are <m>\{0,1\}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the same token, <m>\ZZ_p</m> has trivial automorphism group (even if we ignore its topology!) and so 
        admits a unique <m>\delta</m>-ring structure. The <m>\delta</m>-constant elements are <m>\{0\} \cup \mu_{p-1}</m>.
        This example is the first case of the general construction of rings of Witt vectors; see <xref ref="subsec-Witt-vectors"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-delta-ring-image-of-Z">
      <p>
        Using <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-sum"/>, we can start from the equality <m>\delta(0) = \delta(1) = 1</m> and reconstruct the values of <m>\delta</m>
        on arbitrary integers. Consequently, for any <m>\delta</m>-ring <m>A</m>, the action of <m>\delta</m> on integers is given by
        <xref ref="eq-delta-on-Z"/> <em>even if <m>A</m> is not <m>p</m>-torsion-free</em>. In particular, for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
        <me>
          \delta(p^n) = p^{n-1} (1 - p^{n(p-1)})
        </me>
        and the second factor is not divisible by <m>p</m> unless <m>p</m> is invertible in <m>A</m> (see <xref ref="exa-delta-ring-p-invertible"/>);
        that is, <m>\delta</m> <q>lowers the <m>p</m>-adic order of vanishing by 1</q>.
        By the same token, for any <m>x \in A</m>,
        <me>
          \delta(p^n x) = p^{np} \delta(x) + x^p \delta(p^n) + p \delta(x) \delta(p^n) \equiv p^{n-1} x^p \pmod{p^n}.
        </me>
      </p>
    </remark>
    <example xml:id="exa-delta-ring-cyclotomic">
      <p>
        Building on <xref ref="exa-delta-ring-Z"/>, take <m>A = \ZZ[\mu_n: \gcd(n,p) = 1]</m>. The automorphism <m>\phi: A \to A</m> taking <m>\zeta_n</m>
        to <m>\zeta_n^p</m> for every positive integer <m>n</m> coprime to <m>p</m> is a Frobenius lift; for <m>\delta</m> the corresponding <m>p</m>-derivation, the
        <m>\delta</m>-constant elements are <m>\{0\} \cup \bigcup_{\gcd(n,p)=1} \mu_n</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Take <m>A = \ZZ[x]</m>. For any <m>y \in A</m>, there is a unique Frobenius lift <m>\phi</m> of <m>A</m> for which <m>\phi(x) = x^p + py</m>;
        consequently, there is a unique <m>p</m>-derivation <m>\delta</m> on <m>A</m> with <m>\delta(x) = y</m>. It is tempting to interpret this as the statement that
        <q>the set of <m>p</m>-derivations on <m>A</m> is a free <m>A</m>-module of rank <m>1</m></q>, but in fact there is no natural module structure
        on the set of <m>p</m>-derivations on a general ring.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      You may have noticed that none of these examples has <m>p</m>-torsion. That is not entirely an accident.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-delta-ring-killed-by-p">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, \delta)</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring such that for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m>, <m>p^n = 0</m> in <m>A</m>. Then <m>A = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We prove the claim by induction on <m>n</m>, with the base case <m>n=0</m> being vacuously true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>n>0</m>. Then <m>A</m> is a <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m>-algebra. Consequently,
          by <xref ref="eq-delta-on-Z"/> and <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-image-of-Z"/>, 
          <me>
            0 = \delta(0) = \delta(p^n) = p^{n-1} (1 - p^{np-n})
          </me>
          and the second factor is a unit in <m>A</m>. Hence <m>p^{n-1} = 0</m> in <m>A</m> also, and the induction hypothesis applies.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-killed-by-p"/>, there do exist examples of <m>\delta</m>-rings in which the 
        underlying ring is not <m>p</m>-torsion-free; it is difficult to write these down concretely (in part because it is not enough to specify the
        associated Frobenius lift), but they will be generated naturally by <xref ref="def-delta-ring-right-adjoint"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, quite often we can ignore these examples when checking basic properties of <m>\delta</m>-rings by appealing to the existence of free <m>\delta</m>-rings; see again <xref ref="def-delta-ring-left-adjoint"/>.
        See also <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-p-power-torsion"/> for a variant of <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-killed-by-p"/> that applies to this situation.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-delta-p-torsion">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring. For any <m>x \in A</m> with <m>px = 0</m>, <m>\phi(x) = 0</m>.
          In particular, if <m>\phi</m> is injective, then <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free.

        <p>
          Since <m>x</m> maps to zero in <m>A[p^{-1}]</m>, so then does <m>\phi(x)</m>. It is thus sufficient to check the claim after localizing at <m>(p)</m>,
          that is, we may assume that <m>A</m> is a <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m>-algebra. Now apply <xref ref="eq-delta-ring-product"/> to write
          <me>
            0 = \delta(0) = \delta(px) = x^p \delta(p) + p^p \delta(x) + p \delta(x) \delta(p) = p^p \delta(x) + \phi(x) \delta(p).
          </me>
          By <xref ref="rmk-delta-ring-image-of-Z"/>, <m>\delta(p)</m> is a unit in <m>A</m>; it will thus suffice to check that <m>p^p \delta(x) = 0</m>. This follows by writing
          <me>
            p^p \delta(x) = p^{p-1} (\phi(x) - x^p) = p^{p-2} (\phi(px) - px^p) = 0.

      Just as derivations can be naturally interpreted as giving first-order deformations of a ring, one can interpret <m>p</m>-derivations in the following manner.

        <p>
          The set <m>W_2(A)</m> with the operations <m>+, \times</m> is a commutative ring.
          Moreover, the operation <m>A \mapsto W_2(A)</m> defines a functor from <m>\Ring</m> to <m>\Ring</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          One may see directly from the definitions that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                addition is commutative and the element <me>0 = (0, 0)</me> is an identity element;

            <li>

            <li>
              <p>
                multiplication is commutative and the element <m>1 = (1, 0)</m> is an identity element;

            <li>
              <p>
                the operation <m>A \mapsto W_2(A)</m> defines a functor from the category of commutative rings to the category of sets equipped with
                two binary operations.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          We thus need to check that addition and multiplication are associative and that multiplication distributes over addition.
          These are all conditions asserting the validity of certain polynomial identities in two arbitrary elements <m>x,y \in A</m>;
          thanks to the functoriality, these can be checked after lifting from <m>A</m> to some ring that surjects onto it. In particular,
          we may take <m>A</m> to be a polynomial ring over <m>\ZZ</m>, which in particular is <m>p</m>-torsion-free.

        <p>
          In this setting, the map

          is an injective morphism of sets with two operations for the <em>usual</em> ring operations on <m>A \times A</m>.
          Consequently, we may deduce the desired properties by transferring the knowledge from <m>A \times A</m>.

        Ignoring the second component defines a ring homomorphism <m>\epsilon: W_2(A) \to A</m>. In this notation, a <m>\delta</m>-ring structure on <m>A</m>

        with the composition <m>A \to A/(p) \stackrel{\phi}{\to} A/(p)</m> where <m>\phi</m> denotes the Frobenius on <m>A/(p)</m>. That is,

        In <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Remark 2.3.4, Bhatt also suggests a version of this statement without the <m>p</m>-torsion-free condition:
        for a general ring <m>A</m>, a <m>\delta</m>-structure on <m>A</m> corresponds to an endomorphism <m>\phi: A \to A</m> which is a <q>derived Frobenius lift</q>.
        That is, for <m>\overline{A} = A \otimes^L_{\ZZ} \ZZ/(p)</m>,
        there exists (and is specified!) a homotopy between the composition <m>A \stackrel{\phi}{\to} A \to \overline{A}</m>
        and the composition <m>A \to \overline{A} \stackrel{\mathrm{Frob}}{\to} \overline{A}</m>. This description follows from the previous discussion by interpreting

      <p>
        By <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-limits-colimits"/> plus Freyd's adjoint functor theorem (see <xref ref="bib-Maclane"/>, section V.8), 
        the forgetful functor <m>\Ring_\delta \to \Ring</m> admits both a left adjoint and a right adjoint.
        The left adjoint can be described concretely in the case of the polynomial ring <m>\ZZ[S]</m> (for <m>S</m> an arbitrary set, not necessarily finite); it produces
        the <term>free <m>\delta</m>-ring</term> on <m>S</m> which we denote by <m>\ZZ\{S\}</m>.
        Concretely, the underlying ring of <m>\ZZ\{S\}</m> is given by <m>\ZZ[S_0, S_1, \dots]</m> where each <m>S_i</m> is a copy of <m>S</m>. The map <m>\delta</m> acts on these elements as follows:
        for <m>s \in S</m> corresponding to <m>s_i \in S_i</m>, we have <m>\delta(s_i) = s_{i+1}</m>.
        (To evaluate the left adjoint on an arbitrary ring, we can write it as a quotient of <m>\ZZ[S]</m> for some <m>S</m>, say by using the adjunction between
        commutative rings and sets, and then take a quotient of the resulting free <m>\delta</m>-ring using <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-quotient"/>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        An important corollary of this observation is that every <m>\delta</m>-ring can be written as a quotient of a <m>p</m>-torsion-free <m>\delta</m>-ring;
        this will allow us to reduce many computations to the <m>p</m>-torsion-free case.
      </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Note that in <xref ref="def-delta-ring-left-adjoint"/>, applying the left adjoint to a finitely generated polynomial ring over <m>\ZZ</m> produces a <m>\delta</m>-ring
        whose underlying ring is <em>not noetherian</em>. This suggests that we cannot entertain any hope of staying within the noetherian realm as we go along.

          We are claiming that <m>\delta \circ \phi = \phi \circ \delta</m>; this is a polynomial identity on a single element <m>x \in A</m> and its image under <m>\delta</m>, so by
          lifting to a free <m>\delta</m>-ring we may reduce to the case where <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. In this case, the claim reduces to checking

          Then there is a unique way to equip <m>S^{-1} A</m> with the structure of a <m>\delta</m>-ring so that the localization homomorphism
          <m>A \to S^{-1} A</m> becomes a morphism of <m>\delta</m>-rings.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free; then so is <m>S^{-1} A</m>. Since <m>\phi(S) \subseteq S</m>, the map <m>\phi: A \to A</m>

          In the general case, form a surjection <m>F \to A</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings with <m>F</m> being <m>p</m>-torsion-free.
          Let <m>T</m> be the preimage of <m>S</m> in <m>F</m>; it is again a multiplicative subset such that <m>\phi(T) \subseteq T</m>, so we 
          may uniquely promote <m>T^{-1} F</m> to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>T</m>. Since <xref ref="fig-delta-rings-1"/>
          is a pushout diagram in <m>\Ring</m>, the pushout in <m>\Ring_\delta</m> (which is a colimit, and hence covered by <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-limits-colimits"/>)
          gives us the unique <m>\delta</m>-ring structure on <m>S^{-1} A</m>. (One can also argue more explicitly using <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-quotient"/>.)

        <p>
          The composition from (3) to (1) to (2) to (3) is an equivalence by <xref ref="lem-witt-vectors-perfect-ring"/>.
          In particular, the functor from (2) to (3) is essentially surjective. It will suffice to check that the composition from (3) to (1) to (2)
          is also essentially surjective, as then (2) and (3) will be equivalent and we can use <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>

        <p>
          So now let <m>A</m> be a ring as in (2). Using <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence"/>, we may first see that the map <m>A \to A/(p)</m> has a unique
          multiplicative section <m>[\bullet]</m>, and then that every element has a unique representation as in <xref ref="def-multiplicative-lift"/>.
          This gives us a bijection <m>A \to W(A)</m> of sets by matching up these presentations, which induces an isomorphism modulo <m>p</m>.
          One then needs to check by induction on <m>n</m> that the induced map modulo <m>p^n</m> is also an isomorphism for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
          This is not too onerous to prove by direct computation;
          see for example <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Theorem 1.1.8).
          A second, more conceptual approach is to apply the fact that if <m>A</m> is a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m>, then the cotangent complex
          <m>L_{A/\FF_p}</m> vanishes (compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lemma 2.3.5).

    <title>Big Witt vectors and <m>\lambda</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Although we won't be using this anytime soon, I want to put the previous discussion in some context which <em>might</em> become relevant in the future.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-big-Witt">
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is a unique functor <m>\WW</m> from <m>\Ring</m> to <m>\Ring</m> such that the underlying functor to sets is 
          <me>
            \WW(A) = A \times A \times \cdots
          </me>
          and there is a natural transformation <m>w</m> from <m>W</m> to the ordinary product <m>A \mapsto A^{\NN}</m> given by the <term>ghost map</term>:
          <me>
            (x_n)_{n=1}^\infty \mapsto \left( \sum_{d|n} d x_d^{n/d} \right).

          The ring <m>\WW(A)</m> is called the <term>ring of big Witt vectors</term> over <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The ghost map dictates the values of <m>\WW</m> on <m>\QQ_p</m>-algebras, and in particular ensures that the ring operations are specified by
          certain polynomials over <m>\QQ</m> satisfying various identities that express the various properties of the operations of a commutative ring. 
          To prove the claim, it will suffice to check that these polynomials have coefficients over <m>\ZZ</m>; this can be done one prime at a time.
          We may thus fix a prime <m>p</m> and restrict to consideration of <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m>-algebras; in this case, <m>\WW(A)</m> splits into a collection
          of copies of <m>W(A)</m> indexed by positive integers coprime to <m>p</m>.

        By analogy with <xref ref="def-Witt-structures-p-typical"/>, we can detect various additional structures on <m>\WW(A)</m> using the ghost map.

            For any nonempty subset <m>S</m> of the positive integers which is closed under taking divisors,

            </me>
            (This has a similar effect on the other side of the ghost map.)
            In the case where <m>S = \{1,p,p^2,\dots\}</m> for some prime <m>p</m>, this yields a projection <m>\WW(A) \to W(A)</m>.

          Another interpretation of <m>\WW(A)</m> can be given starting with the bijection of <m>\WW(A)</m> with <m>1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> given by

          When <m>A</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-algebra, the addition operation on <m>\WW(A)</m> imposed by the ghost map corresponds to the multiplication
          of formal power series in <m>1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket</m>. This gives us the underlying additive group on <m>\WW(A)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One then shows that there is a <m>T</m>-adically continuous map <m>\otimes</m> which is natural in <m>A</m>, distributes over addition, and satisfies
          <men xml:id="eq-Witt-series-Frobenius-product">
            (1-aT)^{-1} \otimes (1-bT)^{-1} = (1-abT)^{-1}.

          A more conceptual way to express this last condition is that given two finite projective <m>A</m>-modules <m>M_1, M_2</m> equipped with <m>A</m>-linear endomorphisms <m>S_1, S_2</m>,
          <me>
            \det(1 - T S_1, M_1)^{-1} \otimes \det(1 - T S_2, M_2)^{-1} = \det(1 - T (S_1 \otimes S_2), M_1 \otimes M_2)^{-1}.
          </me>
          This construction of <m>\WW(A)</m> is due to Almkvist <xref ref="bib-Almkvist"/>; see <xref ref="bib-Grayson1"/> for an alternate exposition,
          and <xref ref="bib-Grayson"/> for more on this construction in the context of <m>K</m>-theory of endomorphisms.
        </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
        The interpretation from <xref ref="rmk-Almkvist-interpretation"/> leads naturally to the related notion of a <term><m>\lambda</m>-ring</term>.
        This consists of a ring <m>A</m> together with operations <m>\lambda^n: A \to A</m> for <m>n=0,1,\dots</m> satisfying various conditions.
        To begin with,
        <me>
          \lambda^0(x) = 1, \lambda^1(x) = x (x \in A), \qquad \lambda^n(1) = 0 (n \geq 2).
        </me>
        To state the remaining conditions, define the object
        <me>
          \Lambda(x) = (1 - \lambda_1(x) T + \lambda_2(x) T^2 - \cdots)^{-1} \in 1 + T A \llbracket T \rrbracket.
        </me>
        We then have
        <md>
          <mrow>\Lambda(x + y) = \Lambda(x) \Lambda(y)</mrow>
          <mrow>\Lambda(xy) = \Lambda(x) \otimes \Lambda(y)</mrow>
          <mrow>\Lambda(\lambda^m(x)) = \wedge^m \Lambda(x)</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>\otimes</m> is the map described in <xref ref="rmk-Almkvist-interpretation"/> and <m>\wedge^m</m> is similar;
        it is the <m>T</m>-adically continuous map characterized by
        <me>
          \wedge^m \det(1 - T S, M)^{-1} = \det(1 - T (\wedge^m S), \wedge^m M)^{-1}.
        </me>
        We define in the obvious way a morphism of <m>\lambda</m>-rings (as a morphism of underlying rings which commute with the maps <m>\lambda^n</m>),
        and hence the category <m>\Ring_\lambda</m> of <m>\lambda</m>-rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this definition, we can show that there is a unique way to promote <m>\WW</m> to a functor from <m>\Ring</m> to <m>\Ring_\lambda</m>
        such that <m>\Lambda([x]) = (1-xT)^{-1}</m> for every ring <m>A</m> and every element <m>x \in A</m>.
        We omit details here.
      </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        In any <m>\lambda</m>-ring, we can define additional maps <m>\psi^n</m> for <m>n =0,1,\dots</m> 
        called <term>Adams operations</term>. In the case of <m>\WW(A)</m>, these are characterized by
        <m>T</m>-adic continuity and the property
        <me>
            \psi^n \det(1 - T S, M)^{-1} = \det(1 - T (S^{\otimes n}, M^{\otimes n})^{-1};
        </me>
        this implies that
        <me>
          \psi^n([x]) = [x^n],
        </me>
        from which we can deduce that in fact <m>\psi^n = F_n</m>. In general, the maps <m>\psi^n</m> similarly form a family of pairwise commuting Frobenius lifts;
        moreover, a <m>\lambda</m>-ring is a <m>\delta</m>-ring for every prime <m>p</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional examples of <m>\lambda</m>-rings occurring <q>in nature</q> include:

          <li>
            the ring of symmetric polynomials over <m>\ZZ</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            the representation ring of a finite group (see <xref ref="bib-Knutson"/> for more on the relationship with the previous example);
          </li>
          <li>
            the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite projective modules over a commutative ring;
          </li>
          <li>
            the <m>K</m>-theory of a topological space.

        Yet another point of view on the functor <m>\WW</m>can be found in <xref ref="bib-Borger-Wieland"/>, based on ideas from <xref ref="bib-Tall-Wraith"/>.
        In this approach, one considers objects (called <term>plethories</term>) that act on commutative rings in much the same way that rings acts on modules;
        the functor <m>\WW</m> is represented by a specific one of these, which can be constructed (almost) entirely conceptually.
