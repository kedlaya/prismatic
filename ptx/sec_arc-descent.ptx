    <title>Descent for perfect schemes</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The functor from perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-schemes (i.e., those on which Frobenius is an isomorphism) to arbitrary <m>\FF_p</m>-schemes admits a right adjoint,
        called <term>perfection</term>; for affine schemes, this corresponds to coperfection of rings. Let <m>X_{\perf}</m> denote the perfection of <m>X</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>\Vect(X)</m> denote the category of vector bundles on the scheme <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-perfect-pullback">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a pullback diagram of perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-schemes as in <xref ref="fig-perfect-pullback"/>.
          For any complex <m>K^\bullet</m> of quasicoherent sheaves on <m>Y</m>, the base-change morphism

            Lg^* Rf_* K \to R f'_* L g^{\prime *} K

          We reduce at once to the case where all of the schemes in question are affine.

              The pullback functor

              </me>
              is an equivalence of categories.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For both assertions, we may assume that <m>X = \Spec A</m> is affine; write <m>Z = \Spec A/I</m>.
          Write <m>nE</m> for the subscheme of <m>Y</m> cut out by <m>I^n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For (1), we may assume <m>\calF = \calO</m>. By our hypotheses, we have <m>\calO(X) \cong \calO(Y)</m> and <m>\calO(Z) \cong \calO(E)</m>
          by Stein factorization, and similarly after taking perfections. Since <m>X</m> and <m>Z</m> are both affine, it remains to check that
          <m>H^i(Y_{\perf}, \calO) \to H^i(E_{\perf}, \calO)</m> is an isomorphism for each <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, we follow <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Schwede-Takagi"/>, Lemma 3.9 (which is written using the Nisnevich topology, but the Zariski topology works equally well).
          By <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 02OB, point (1), there exists a constant <m>c</m> such that for <m>n \geq c</m>,
          <me>
            \ker(H^i(Y, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)) \subseteq I^{n-c} H^i (Y,\calO).
          </me>
          Note that <m>H^i(Y, \calO)</m> is a finitely generated <m>A</m>-module which, since <m>f</m> is a blowup and <m>i \gt 0</m>, is supported entirely on <m>Z</m>.
          Hence for <m>n \gg 0</m>, <m>I^{n-c}</m> annihilates <m>H^i(Y, \calO)</m>  and so 
          <men xml:id="eq-h-coverings-perfect1">
            H^i(Y, \calO) \hookrightarrow H^i(E_n, \calO) \qquad (n \gg 0).
          </men>
          On the other hand, by <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 020B, point (3), for <m>m \gg n \gg 0</m> we have
          <men xml:id="eq-h-coverings-perfect2">
            \im(H^i(E_m, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)) = \im(H^i(Y, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)).
          </men>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fix a value <m>n \gg 0</m> that is large enough for both <xref ref="eq-h-coverings-perfect1"/> and <xref ref="eq-h-coverings-perfect2"/> to hold.
          Then for <m>e \gg 0</m>, the image of <m>\phi^e: H^i(E_n, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)</m> is contained in the image of <m>H^i(Y, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)</m>:
          to see this, refactor the former map as 
          <me>
            H^i(E_n, \calO) \stackrel{\phi^e}{\to} H^i(E_{p^e n}, \calO) \to H^i(E_n, \calO)
          </me>
          and then apply <xref ref="eq-h-coverings-perfect2"/>. By this plus <xref ref="eq-h-coverings-perfect1"/>, we see that
          <me>
            \colim_\phi H^i(Y, \calO) = \colim_\phi H^i(E_n, \calO)
          </me>
          and hence
          <md>
            <mrow>H^i(Y_{\perf}, \calO) &amp;= \colim_\phi H^i(E_n, \calO)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp;= \colim_\phi H^i(E, \calO) = H^i(E_{\perf}, \calO)</mrow>
          </md>
          as claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For (2), we follow <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze-grassmannian"/>, Lemma 4.6.
          By the Beauville-Laszlo theorem (see <xref ref="rmk-beauville-laszlo"/>), we may assume that <m>A</m> is (classically) <m>I</m>-complete.
          We may also assume that we start with an object in <m>\Vect(Y) \times_{\Vect(E)} \Vect(Z)</m>.
          Let <m>\calI</m> be the inverse image ideal sheaf of <m>I</m>; by the construction of the blowup, <m>\calI</m> is an <em>ample</em> invertible sheaf on <m>Y</m>.
          Consequently, by Serre vanishing, we may choose some <m>n</m> such that
          <men xml:id="eq-h-coverings-perfect3">
            H^i(Y, \calI^k/\calI^{k+1}) = 0 \qquad (k \geq n).
          </men>
          Since <m>X</m> is affine and complete along <m>Z</m>, <m>\Vect(X) \to \Vect(Z)</m> is an equivalence of categories (<xref ref="exer-vb-essentially-surjective"/>).
          We thus have objects <m>\calE \in \Vect(X)</m>, <m>\calF \in \Vect(Y)</m> and an isomorphism <m>\psi: f^* \calE|_E \cong \calF|_E</m>.
          By pulling back by a suitable power of <m>\phi</m>, we may construct another isomorphism <m>\psi_n: f^* \calE|_{nE} \cong \calF|_{nE}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now observe that for <m>m \geq n</m>, an isomorphism <m>\psi_m: f^* \calE|_{mE} \cong \calF|_{mE}</m>
          can be promoted to an isomorphism <m>\psi_{m+1}: f^* \calE|_{(m+1)E} \cong \calF|_{(m+1)E}</m>:
          namely, the obstruction to lifting belongs to 
          <me>
            H^1(Y, \calI^m/\calI^{m+1} \otimes \sheafHom(f^* \calE, \calF))
          </me>
          which vanishes by <xref ref="eq-h-coverings-perfect3"/>. Since
          <me>
            \Vect(Y) \to \lim_m \Vect(mE)
          </me>
          is an equivalence by the formal existence theorem (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0885),
          we deduce the desired result.

      </proof>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Point (1) of <xref ref="lem-h-coverings-perfect"/> can also be formulated as follows: for <m>j: Z \to X</m> the inclusion and <m>g: E \to X</m> the induced map
        (and reusing the names <m>f,g,j</m> for the images of these maps under the perfection functor), we have a distinguished triangle

            \calF \to Rf_* f^* \calF \oplus Rj_* j^* \calF \to Rg_* g^* \calF \to

              The structure presheaf <m>\calO</m> on the category of perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-schemes is an arc-sheaf.
              Moreover, for any affine perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-scheme <m>X</m>, the <m>i</m>-th cohomology group of <m>\calO</m> for the arc-topology on <m>X</m>
              vanishes for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.

          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, both assertions hold for the flat (fpqc) topology in place of the arc-topology thanks to classical faithfully flat descent
          (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0238).
        </p>
        <p>
          We next upgrade both assertions from the flat topology to the v-topology.
          Every v-covering is a cofiltered limit of h-coverings, so we may reduce to considering perfections of h-coverings of finite type <m>\FF_p</m>-schemes.
          Since the h-topology is generated by faithfully flat coverings and proper surjective morphisms, and we already know descent for the former.
          we may reduce to considering the perfection of a proper surjective morphism. Moreover, by Raynaud-Gruson flattening <xref ref="bib-Raynaud-Gruson"/>,
          we may further reduce to considering the case of a blowup, to which we may apply <xref ref="lem-h-coverings-perfect"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we upgrade both assertions from the v-topology to the arc-topology.
          By passing to affines and then pulling back along a cover as in <xref ref="exa-v-cover"/>,
          we may reduce to considering a covering as in <xref ref="exa-excision-for-valuation"/> (compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, Theorem 4.1).
          For this, apply <xref ref="cor-perfect-pullback"/> and <xref ref="lem-glueing"/>.

          Let <m>M_1, M_2, M_{12}</m> be objects of <m>\Vect(R_1), \Vect(R_2), \Vect(R_{12})</m> equipped with isomorphisms <m>M_i \otimes_{R_i} R_{12} \cong M_{12}</m>
          and put <m>M = \ker(M_1 \oplus M_2 \to M_{12})</m>; we will show that <m>M \in \Vect(R)</m> and that the induced maps <m>M \otimes_R R_i \to M_i</m>
          are isomorphisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first check that the maps <m>M \otimes_R R_i \to M_i</m> are all surjective.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Given <m>x \in M_1</m>, we can write the image of <m>x</m> in <m>M_{12}</m> as <m>y/f</m> for some <m>y \in M_2</m> 
                and some <m>f \in R</m> which becomes a unit in <m>R_1</m>.
                Then <m>(fx, y)</m> is an element of <m>M</m> mapping to <m>fx \in M_1</m>, so <m>M \otimes_R R_1 \to M_1</m> is surjective.

            <li>
              <p>
                Since <m>R_1 \oplus R_2 \to R_{12}</m> is surjective,
                <m>M \otimes_R (R_1 \oplus R_2) \to M_{12}</m> is surjective.

              <p>
                Given <m>x \in M_2</m>, we may map <m>x</m> to <m>M_{12}</m> and then lift it to <m>(x_1, x_2) \in M_1 \oplus M_2</m> in the image of <m>M \otimes_R (R_1 \oplus R_2)</m>.
                By construction, <m>(x_1, x_2-x) \in M</m>, so the image of <m>M \otimes_{R_1} \to R_1</m> contains both <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_2-x</m>.
                Hence <m>M \otimes_R R_2 \to M_2</m> is also surjective.

        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that <m>M</m> is a finite <m>R</m>-module.
          From the previous discussion, we see that there exist a finite free <m>R</m>-module <m>F</m> and a morphism <m>F \to M</m> of <m>R</m>-modules such that,
          for <m>F_i = F \otimes_R R_*</m>, the induced map <m>F_i \to M_i</m> is surjective. Put <m>N = \ker(F \to M)</m> and <m>N_i = \ker(F_i \to M_i)</m>.
          We have a diagram as in <xref ref="fig-glueing-square3"/> in which all of the squares commute and all of the rows and columns are exact,
          except possibly for the dashed arrows. However, because the modules <m>M_i</m> are projective,
          the maps <m>N_i \otimes_{R_i} R_{12} \to N_{12}</m> are isomorphisms, so all of the preceding logic applies to them also;
          this allows us to add the dashed horizontal arrow to the diagram, and hence also the dashed vertical arrow.

          We finally check that <m>M</m> is a projective <m>R</m>-module. By repeating the logic used to construct <xref ref="fig-glueing-square3"/>, we obtain another commutative diagram

          The element of <m>\Hom_{R_1}(M_1,M_1) \oplus \Hom_{2}(M_2,M_2)</m> corresponding to the identity maps
          has zero horizontal image, so by the snake lemma it lifts to some <m>\Hom_{R_1}(M_1,F_1) \oplus \Hom_{R_2}(M_2,F_2)</m>
          which maps to zero in <m>\Hom_{R_{12}}(M_{12},F_{12})</m>. This gives us maps <m>M_1 \to F_1, M_2 \to F_2</m> which agree on <m>M</m> and map it into <m>F</m>;
          the resulting map <m>M \to F</m> splits the surjection <m>F \to M</m>, showing that <m>M</m> is projective.

    <title>Arc-descent for étale cohomology</title>
    <p>
      We record another form of descent for the arc-topology, this time in the realm of étale cohomology.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-arc-descent-etale">
      <title>Arc-descent for étale cohomology</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>R \in \Ring</m>, let <m>\calF</m> be a torsion sheaf on <m>(\Spec R)_{\et}</m>. Then the functor
          <me>
            (f: X \to \Spec R) \mapsto R\Gamma(X_{\et}, f^* \calF)
          </me>
          from <m>R</m>-schemes to <m>D(\ZZ)^{\geq 0}</m> satisfies descent for the arc-topology. That is, for <m>f: Y \to X</m> an arc-covering, there is a natural quasi-isomorphism
          from <m>R\Gamma(X_{\et}, f^* \calF)</m> to the totalization of the Čech-Alexander complex <m>R\Gamma(Y_{\bullet,\et}, f^* \calF)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first verify descent for a v-covering <m>f: Y \to X</m>, in which we may assume both schemes are qcqs. 
          We can then write <m>Y</m> as a filtered limit of some finitely presented <m>X</m>-schemes, each of which is itself a v-covering, with affine transition maps;
          we may thus reduce to dealing with a finitely presented <m>v</m>-covering.
          By arguing as in <xref ref="bib-Rydh"/>, Theorem 3.12, we may refine this covering by a composition of a quasicompact open covering with a proper surjective morphism.
          As descent for the former is immediate, we may further assume that <m>f</m> is proper surjective.
          In this case, we are in the usual setting of cohomological descent for étale cohomology.
          For this, we may assume that <m>X</m> is the spectrum of a strictly henselian local ring with closed point <m>x</m>.
          By the proper base change theorem, <m>\calF(Y) \cong \calF(Y_x)</m>, so we may check the claim after pulling back along <m>x \to X</m>.
          But the resulting map <m>Y_x \to x</m> has a section, so it satisfies descent for purely formal reasons.
          See <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Mathew"/>, Proposition 5.2 for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain descent for the arc-topology, as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-v-descent-perfect"/>
          we may use v-descent to reduce to a covering as in <xref ref="exa-excision-for-valuation"/> in which <m>V</m> is AIC.
          In this case, <m>V/\frakp</m> is also AIC, so both <m>V</m> and <m>V/\frakp</m> are strictly henselian with the same residue field.
          It follows that the functor in question takes the same values on <m>V</m> and <m>V/\frakp</m>, and takes the same values on <m>V_\frakp</m> and <m>\kappa(\frakp)</m>.
