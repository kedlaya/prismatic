      In this lecture, we study perfect prisms (i.e., prisms with a bijective Frobenius map) in detail. These end up being closely related to <term>perfectoid rings</term>,
      which appear frequently in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory; however, we will not use too much of the existing theory of perfectoid rings, and in fact we will end
      up recovering some of it via a different approach.

    <title>Distinguished elements in perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the condition of an element of a <m>\delta</m>-ring being distinguished is meant to capture the idea that
      <q>the <m>p</m>-adic order of vanishing equals 1</q>. For perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings, we can further develop this metaphor to assert that
      <q>the linear coefficient in <m>p</m> is a unit</q>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-perfect">
      <statement>
        <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              An element <m>d \in W(R)</m> is distinguished if and only if its series expansion <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n] p^n</m>, the coefficient
              <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any distinguished element is a non-zerodivisor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a distinguished element <m>d \in W(R)</m>, the <m>p</m>-power torsion in <m>W(R)/(d)</m> is killed by <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We prove (1) and leave the rest as an exercise (<xref ref="exer-distinguished-perfect"/>). For <m>d = \sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n]</m>,
          use <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence"/> to write <m>d^p \equiv [x_0]^p \pmod{p^2}</m> and
          <me>
            p\delta(d) = \phi(d)-d^p \equiv p [x_1]^p \pmod{p^2}.
          </me>
          Then note that <m>[x_1]</m> is a unit if and only if <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The criterion for distinguished elements in <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> coincides with Fontaine's notion of a
        <term>primitive element of degree 1</term>. While this terminology was introduced in <xref ref="bib-Fontaine-Bourbaki"/>, it echoes similar constructions found elsewhere
        (e.g., <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-NG"/>.

        A prism <m>(A,I)</m> is <term>perfect</term> if <m>A</m> is a perfect <m>\delta</m>-ring.

    <theorem xml:id="lem-perfect-prisms-structure">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a perfect prism.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ideal <m>I</m> is principal, and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element and a non-zerodivisor.

          <li>
            <p>
              The ring <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and classically <m>(p, I)</m>-complete.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have a canonical isomorphism <m>A \cong W(A/(p))</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m> and <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. In particular, <m>(A,I)</m> is a bounded prism.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-prism-ideal-generator"/>, the ideal <m>I</m> is principal and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element.
          By <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ring <m>A/(p)</m> is perfect (by functoriality) and derived <m>I</m>-complete (by <xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian"/>,
          it being the cokernel of <m>A \stackrel{\times p}{\to} A</m>). By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>A/(p)</m>
          is also classically <m>I</m>-complete. By induction on <m>n</m> using the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 p^{n-1}A/p^n A \to \to A/p^n \to A/p^{n-1} \to 0
          </me>
          and the isomorphism <m>A/p \cong p^{n-1}A/p^n A</m> of <m>A</m>-modules (a consequence of <m>A</m> being <m>p</m>-torsion-free),
          we deduce that each quotient <m>A/(p^n)</m> is classically <m>I</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and derived <m>p</m>-complete, it is also classically <m>p</m>-complete by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>.
          By the previous paragraph, it is also classically <m>(p, I)</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>, <m>A \cong W(A/p)</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a non-zerodivisor.
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m>.

    </theorem>
    <prop>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The inclusion of perfect prisms into the category of prisms admits a left adjoint. Given a prism <m>(A, I)</m>, the left adjoint is obtained by taking
          the classical <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of the coperfection of <m>A</m> (which we call the <term>coperfection</term> of <m>(A,I)</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>A'</m> be the coperfection of <m>A</m>; by <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A'</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. 
          Let <m>A''</m> be the classical <m>p</m>-completion of <m>A'</m>; by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>, <m>A''</m> is also the derived <m>p</m>-completion.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A</m>.
          Now <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A'' \cong W(A''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each positive integer <m>n</m>, we may now argue as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> that the derived <m>I</m>-completion of <m>A/p^n</m>
          coincides with the classical completion. Consequently, if we take <m>A'''</m> to be the classical <m>(p, I)</m>-completion of <m>A''</m> (or equivalently of <m>A'</m>), 
          then <m>A'''</m> also equals the derived <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of either <m>A'</m> or <m>A''</m>.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A'''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A''</m>.
          Again, <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A''' \cong W(A'''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, <m>(A''', IA''')</m> is a prism (the conditions on the ideal <m>IA'''</m> are implied by the corresponding conditions on <m>I</m>)
          and <m>A'''</m> is universal for maps of <m>A</m> to derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete <m>\delta</m>-rings. Thus the proof is complete.

          We then have a commutative diagram as in <xref ref="fig-tilting-diagram"/> 
          in which the horizontal arrows are all surjective,
          the vertical arrows are all reductions modulo <m>p</m>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          Everything will follow once we construct a natural isomorphism <m>A \cong W(R^\flat)</m>. By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>,
          it will suffice to construct a natural isomorphism <m>A/p \cong R^\flat</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>), <m>I</m> admits a generator <m>d</m> which is a distinguished element.
          By definition, we have <m>A/p = R/(p,d)</m>. For each positive integer <m>n</m>, the <m>n</m>-fold Frobenius
          <m>A/(p,d) \to A/(p,d)</m> identifies with the canonical map <m>A/(p,d^n) \to A/(p,d)</m> compatibly with <m>n</m>,
          so the limit <m>\lim_\phi R/p</m> gets identified with <m>\lim_\phi A/(p, d^n)</m>.
          The latter is naturally isomorphic to <m>A/(p)</m> because the latter is clasically <m>d</m>-complete
          (<xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>).

          The functor <m>(A,I) \mapsto A/I</m> from perfect prisms to rings is fully faithful.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It will suffice to explain how to recover <m>A</m> and <m>I</m> functorially from <m>R = A/I</m>. Set <m>R^\flat = \lim_\phi R/p</m>;
          because <m>R</m> is in the essential image of the functor, we can see that <m>\phi: R/p \to R/p</m> is surjective, and so <m>R^\flat \to R/p</m>
          is surjective. Using <xref ref="lem-maps-from-Witt-rings"/>, we may lift <m>R^\flat \to R/p</m> uniquely to a map <m>W(R^\flat) \to R</m>, which is also surjective.
          We can now reconstruct the diagram of <xref ref="fig-tilting-diagram"/> to recover <m>A = W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>I = \ker(A \to R)</m>.

        A <term>refract</term> is a ring of the form <m>A/I</m> for some perfect prism <m>(A, I)</m>.
        By <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the category of refracts (defined as a full subcategory of the category of commutative rings) 
        is equivalent to the category of perfect prisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>R = A/I</m> a refract, we write <m>R^\flat</m> for the perfection of <m>R/p</m> and call it the <term>tilt</term> of <m>R</m>.
        We also say that <m>R</m> is an <term>untilt</term> of <m>R^\flat</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        For any perfect ring <m>R</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>, the pair <m>(W(R), (p))</m> is a perfect prism with untilt and tilt both equal to <m>R</m>.

      <p>
        Let <m>R^\flat</m> be the perfect ring <m>t</m>-adic completion of <m>\FF_p[t^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> and put <m>A = W(R^\flat)</m>.
        We can construct multiple perfect prisms <m>(A, I)</m> with tilt <m>R^\flat</m>, such as the following.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} [t+1]^i</m>. The untilt <m>A/I</m> is isomorphic to the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[\mu_{p^\infty}]</m>
              via a map with <m>[t+1]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto \zeta_{p^n}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is isomorphic to the prism from <xref ref="exa-Ainf-prism"/>
              and is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-q-de-Rham-prism"/>.

              Take <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d = p - [t]</m>. The untilt <m>A/I</m> is isomorphic to the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[p^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> via a map with
              <m>[t]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto p^{p^{-n}}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-Breuil-Kisin-prism"/> in the special case
              <m>K = \QQ_p, \pi = p</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        While the terminology of <term>tilting</term> and <term>untilting</term> is now quite commonly used, 
        our references to the <term>category of refracts</term> is highly nonstandard; in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze1"/> and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, 
        objects of this category are called <term>perfectoid rings</term>.
        However, that usage is incompatible with most prior literature; in older terminology these would be <term>integral perfectoid rings</term>.
        To minimize confusion, we sidestep this issue by using a nonce terminology here.

      Crucially, <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract"/> enables us to produce many refracts in cases where it is not so obvious how to give a direct construction
      of the corresponding perfect prism. In particular, we can make some prisms without specifying either a <m>\delta</m>-ring structure or a Frobenius lift!

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first check that <m>J</m> is radical. If <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p \in J</m>, then <m>x^p I = 0</m>; since <m>R</m> is perfect,
          it follows that <m>xI = 0</m> and so <m>x \in J</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that <m>I+J</m> is radical. The ideal <m>I+J</m> is the kernel of <m>R \to R/I \otimes_R R/J</m>; the target is a colimit of perfect rings and hence
          is itself perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The square in question is already a pushout square at the level of groups, hence also at the level of rings. To check that it is a pullback square, we must check 
          that <m>I \cap J = 0</m>. To this end, choose <m>x \in I \cap J</m>; since <m>x \in J</m> we have <m>xI = 0</m>, but since <m>x \in I</m> this implies <m>x^2 = 0</m>
          and finally <m>x = 0</m> because <m>R</m> is perfect.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Any refract is a reduced ring.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-structure-of-untilts"/>, we may reduce to the cases of a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m> and of a <m>p</m>-torsion-free untilted ring.
          In the former case, it is evident that any perfect ring is reduced. in the latter case, let <m>R</m> be the refract in question. 
          Apply <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> to choose an element <m>\varpi \in R</m> such that <m>\varpi^p = pu</m> for some unit <m>u \in R^\times</m>.
          It will suffice to check that any <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p = 0</m> vanishes, or (because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-adically separated)
          that any such <m>x</m> is divisible by <m>\varpi^n</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>. We prove this by induction starting with the base case <m>n=0</m>.
          Given that <m>x = \pi^n y</m> for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m> and some <m>y \in R</m>, we have <m>\varpi^{np} y^p = 0</m> and hence
          <m>y^p = 0</m> because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. By <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> again, the kernel of the Frobenius on <m>R/p</m> is
          generated by <m>\varpi</m>; hence <m>y \in \varpi R</m> and <m>x \in \varpi^{n+1} R</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          One approach is to use the theorem of Ax-Sen-Tate (see <xref ref="bib-Ax"/>); this implies for example that if <m>K</m> is a (possibly infinite) Galois algebraic extension
          of <m>\QQ_p</m> with Galois group <m>G</m>, then the invariant subfield of the completion of <m>K</m> under the action of <m>G</m> is equal to <m>\QQ_p</m>.
