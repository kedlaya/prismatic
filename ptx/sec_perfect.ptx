        The theory of perfectoid rings has been described in numerous sources. Instead of recapping this history here, see
        <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-AWS"/> (especially Remark 2.3.18).

      In this lecture, we study perfect prisms in detail. These end up being closely related to <term>perfectoid rings</term>,
      which appear frequently in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory.

  <subsection>
    <title>Distinguished elements in perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the condition of an element of a <m>\delta</m>-ring being distinguished is meant to capture the idea that
      <q>the <m>p</m>-adic order of vanishing equals 1</q>. For perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings, we can further develop this metaphor to assert that
      <q>the linear coefficient in <m>p</m> is a unit</q>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-perfect">
      <statement>
        <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              An element <m>d \in W(R)</m> is distinguished if and only if its series expansion <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n] p^n</m>, the coefficient
              <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any distinguished element is a non-zerodivisor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a distinguished element <m>d \in W(R)</m>, the <m>p</m>-power torsion in <m>W(R)/(d)</m> is killed by <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We prove (1) and leave the rest as an exercise (<xref ref="exer-distinguished-perfect"/>). For <m>d = \sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n]</m>,
          use <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence"/> to write <m>d^p \equiv [x_0]^p \pmod{p^2}</m> and
          <me>
            p\delta(d) = \phi(d)-d^p \equiv p [x_1]^p \pmod{p^2}.
          </me>
          Then note that <m>[x_1]</m> is a unit if and only if <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The criterion for distinguished elements in <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> coincides with Fontaine's notion of a
        <term>primitive element of degree 1</term> (terminology introduced in <xref ref="bib-Fontaine-Bourbaki"/>).

    <definition>
      <p>
        A prism <m>(A,I)</m> is <term>perfect</term> if <m>A</m> is a perfect <m>\delta</m>-ring.
      </p>
    </definition>
    
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a perfect prism. Then <m>I</m> is principal and any generator of it is a distinguished element.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is immediate from <xref ref="lem-prism-ideal-generator"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The inclusion of perfect prisms into the category of prisms admits a left adjoint. Given a prism <m>(A, I)</m>, the left adjoint is obtained by taking
          the derived <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of the coperfection of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Lemma 3.9.
