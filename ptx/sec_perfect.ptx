      In this lecture, we study perfect prisms (i.e., prisms with a bijective Frobenius map) in detail. These end up being closely related to <term>perfectoid rings</term>,
      which appear frequently in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory; however, we will not use too much of the existing theory of perfectoid rings, and in fact we will end
      up recovering some of it via a different approach.

    <title>Distinguished elements in perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the condition of an element of a <m>\delta</m>-ring being distinguished is meant to capture the idea that
      <q>the <m>p</m>-adic order of vanishing equals 1</q>. For perfect <m>\delta</m>-rings, we can further develop this metaphor to assert that
      <q>the linear coefficient in <m>p</m> is a unit</q>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-perfect">
      <statement>
        <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              An element <m>d \in W(R)</m> is distinguished if and only if its series expansion <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n] p^n</m>, the coefficient
              <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any distinguished element is a non-zerodivisor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a distinguished element <m>d \in W(R)</m>, the <m>p</m>-power torsion in <m>W(R)/(d)</m> is killed by <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We prove (1) and leave the rest as an exercise (<xref ref="exer-distinguished-perfect"/>). For <m>d = \sum_{n=0}^\infty [x_n]</m>,
          use <xref ref="eq-promote-congruence"/> to write <m>d^p \equiv [x_0]^p \pmod{p^2}</m> and
          <me>
            p\delta(d) = \phi(d)-d^p \equiv p [x_1]^p \pmod{p^2}.
          </me>
          Then note that <m>[x_1]</m> is a unit if and only if <m>x_1</m> is a unit.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The criterion for distinguished elements in <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> coincides with Fontaine's notion of a
        <term>primitive element of degree <m>1</m></term>. While this terminology was introduced in <xref ref="bib-Fontaine-Bourbaki"/>, it echoes similar constructions found elsewhere
        (e.g., <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-NG"/>.

        A prism <m>(A,I)</m> is <term>perfect</term> if <m>A</m> is a perfect <m>\delta</m>-ring.

    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="lem-perfect-prisms-structure">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be a perfect prism.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ideal <m>I</m> is principal, and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element and a non-zerodivisor.

          <li>
            <p>
              The ring <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and classically <m>(p, I)</m>-complete. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have a canonical isomorphism <m>A \cong W(A/(p))</m> of <m>\delta</m>-rings.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m> and <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. In particular, <m>(A,I)</m> is a bounded prism.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-prism-ideal-generator"/>, the ideal <m>I</m> is principal and any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a distinguished element.
          By <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ring <m>A/(p)</m> is perfect (by functoriality) and derived <m>I</m>-complete (by <xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian"/>,
          it being the cokernel of <m>A \stackrel{\times p}{\to} A</m>). By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>A/(p)</m>
          is also classically <m>I</m>-complete. By induction on <m>n</m> using the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 p^{n-1}A/p^n A \to \to A/p^n \to A/p^{n-1} \to 0
          </me>
          and the isomorphism <m>A/p \cong p^{n-1}A/p^n A</m> of <m>A</m>-modules (a consequence of <m>A</m> being <m>p</m>-torsion-free),
          we deduce that each quotient <m>A/(p^n)</m> is classically <m>I</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>A</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free and derived <m>p</m>-complete, it is also classically <m>p</m>-complete by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>.
          By the previous paragraph, it is also classically <m>(p, I)</m>-complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/>, <m>A \cong W(A/p)</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, any generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> is a non-zerodivisor.
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, <m>(A/p)[I^\infty] = (A/p)[I]</m>. By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, <m>(A/I)[p^\infty] = (A/I)[p]</m>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The inclusion of the categroy of perfect prisms into <m>\Prm</m> admits a left adjoint. Given a prism <m>(A, I)</m>, the left adjoint is obtained by taking
          the classical <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of the coperfection of <m>A</m> (which we call the <term>coperfection</term> of <m>(A,I)</m>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>A'</m> be the coperfection of <m>A</m>; by <xref ref="lem-delta-p-torsion"/>, <m>A'</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. 
          Let <m>A''</m> be the classical <m>p</m>-completion of <m>A'</m>; by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>, <m>A''</m> is also the derived <m>p</m>-completion.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A</m>.
          Now <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A'' \cong W(A''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each positive integer <m>n</m>, we may now argue as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> that the derived <m>I</m>-completion of <m>A/p^n</m>
          coincides with the classical completion. Consequently, if we take <m>A'''</m> to be the classical <m>(p, I)</m>-completion of <m>A''</m> (or equivalently of <m>A'</m>), 
          then <m>A'''</m> also equals the derived <m>(p,I)</m>-completion of either <m>A'</m> or <m>A''</m>.
          By <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/>, <m>A'''</m> can be canonically promoted to a <m>\delta</m>-ring over <m>A''</m>.
          Again, <xref ref="prop-perfect-delta-rings"/> implies <m>A''' \cong W(A'''/p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, <m>(A''', IA''')</m> is a prism (the conditions on the ideal <m>IA'''</m> are implied by the corresponding conditions on <m>I</m>)
          and <m>A'''</m> is universal for maps of <m>A</m> to derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete <m>\delta</m>-rings. Thus the proof is complete.

        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>), <m>I</m> admits a generator <m>d</m> which is a distinguished element.
          By definition, we have <m>A/p = R/(p,d)</m>. For each positive integer <m>n</m>, the <m>n</m>-fold Frobenius
          <m>A/(p,d) \to A/(p,d)</m> identifies with the canonical map <m>A/(p,d^n) \to A/(p,d)</m> compatibly with <m>n</m>,
          so the limit <m>\lim_\phi R/p</m> gets identified with <m>\lim_\phi A/(p, d^n)</m>.
          The latter is naturally isomorphic to <m>A/(p)</m> because the latter is clasically <m>d</m>-complete

      <proof>
        <p>
          It will suffice to explain how to recover <m>A</m> and <m>I</m> functorially from <m>R = A/I</m>. Set <m>R^\flat = \lim_\phi R/p</m>;
          because <m>R</m> is in the essential image of the functor, we can see that <m>\phi: R/p \to R/p</m> is surjective, and so <m>R^\flat \to R/p</m>
          is surjective. Using <xref ref="lem-maps-from-Witt-rings"/>, we may lift <m>R^\flat \to R/p</m> uniquely to a map <m>W(R^\flat) \to R</m>, which is also surjective.
          We can now reconstruct the diagram of <xref ref="fig-tilting-diagram"/> to recover <m>A = W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>I = \ker(A \to R)</m>.

        A <term>lens</term> is a ring of the form <m>A/I</m> for some perfect prism <m>(A, I)</m>.
        By <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the category of lenses (defined as a full subcategory of the category of commutative rings) 
        is equivalent to the category of perfect prisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>R = A/I</m> a lens, we write <m>R^\flat</m> for the perfection of <m>R/p</m> and call it the <term>tilt</term> of <m>R</m>.
        We also say that <m>R</m> is an <term>untilt</term> of <m>R^\flat</m>.

        For any perfect ring <m>R</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>, the pair <m>(W(R), (p))</m> is a perfect prism with untilt and tilt both equal to <m>R</m>.
        In particular, <m>R</m> is a lens.

        Let <m>R^\flat</m> be the <m>t</m>-adic completion of <m>\FF_p[t^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> and put <m>A = W(R^\flat)</m>.
        We can construct multiple perfect prisms <m>(A, I)</m> with tilt <m>R^\flat</m>, such as the following.
        <ul>
          <li>

              Take <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} [t+1]^i</m>. The untilt <m>A/I</m> is isomorphic to the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[\mu_{p^\infty}]</m>
              via a map with <m>[t+1]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto \zeta_{p^n}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is isomorphic to the prism from <xref ref="exa-Ainf-prism"/>
              and is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-q-de-Rham-prism"/>.

              <m>[t]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto p^{p^{-n}}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-Breuil-Kisin-prism"/> in the special case

      <p>
        While the terminology of <term>tilting</term> and <term>untilting</term> is now quite commonly used, 
        our references to the <term>category of lenses</term> is highly nonstandard; in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze1"/> and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, 
        objects of this category are called <term>perfectoid rings</term>.
        However, that usage is incompatible with most prior literature; in older terminology these would be <term>integral perfectoid rings</term>.
        To minimize confusion, we sidestep this issue by using a nonce terminology based on the metaphor of prisms.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be the perfect prism with <m>A/I \cong R</m> and let <m>R^\flat</m> be the tilt.
          Then <m>R^\flat</m> is perfect and <m>R/p \cong R^\flat/p</m>, so <m>R/p</m> is semiperfect. This proves (1).
        </p>
        <p>
          For (2), apply <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> to write <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d \in A</m> a distinguished element.
          By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, we have <m>d = [a_0] - pu</m> for some <m>a_0 \in R^\flat</m> and some unit <m>u \in A^\times</m>.
          We may then take <m>\varpi</m> to be the image of <m>[a_0]</m> to obtain (2).
        </p>
        <p>
          To check (3), we show that <m>\sqrt{pR} = \bigcup_n (\varpi^{p^{-n}})</m>. Since the left side contains the right side,
          it suffices to observe that the quotient <m>\overline{R} = R / \bigcup_n (\varpi^{p^{-n}})</m> is itself perfect, and hence reduced.
        </p>

          To check (4), keep notation as above; it suffices to check that <m>R[p]</m> is killed by <m>[a_0^{p^{-n}}]</m> for each <m>n</m>
          (since these elements generate <m>\sqrt{pR}</m>). To show that <m>R[p]</m> is killed by <m>[a_0^{p^{-n}}]</m> for some particular <m>n</m>,
          note that neither <m>p</m> nor <m>d</m> is a zerodivisor in <m>A</m> (by <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>
          and <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>), so we may write

      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>R = A/I</m> is a lens, then all of the stated conditions follow directly from 
          <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> and <m>R/p</m> is semiperfect by <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>.
          Conversely, suppose that these conditions hold; we will show that
          for <m>A = W(R^\flat), I = \ker(\theta_R)</m>,
          the pair <m>(A,I)</m> is a perfect prism with <m>A/I \cong R</m>.
          Since <m>\theta_R</m> induces a surjective map mod <m>p</m>,
          it is in fact surjective, so <m>A/I \cong R</m>. The ring <m>A</m> is classically <m>p</m>-complete;
          we may check that it is classically <m>(p,I)</m>-complete 
          by checking that <m>A/p \cong R^\flat</m> is classically <m>I</m>-complete,
          which is straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, we must show that <m>I</m> admits a distinguished generator.
          To this end, choose <m>x,v \in A</m> lifting <m>\varpi,u</m> and put <m>g = pv - x^p \in \ker(I)</m>.
          The series expansion of <m>x</m> has zero coefficient of <m>p</m>; since <m>v</m> is a unit (because <m>A</m>
          is <m>I</m>-local), we deduce from <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> that <m>g</m> is distinguished.
          Since <m>I</m> is principal, we may apply <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> to deduce that <m>g</m> is in fact a generator.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>R</m> is a lens. In light of <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract"/>, we only need to check that
          <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-normal. Take <m>\varpi</m> as in <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>.
          Given <m>x \in R[p^{-1}]</m> with <m>x^p \in R</m>, let <m>n</m> be the smallest nonnegative integer such that
          <m>\varpi^n x \in R</m>. If <m>n > 0</m>, then by writing
          <me>
            (\varpi^n x)^p = \varpi^{np} x^p \in \varpi^{np} R \subset \varpi^p R
          </me>
          and using that the Frobenius map <m>R/\varpi \to R/\varpi^p</m> is a bijection, we see that
          <m>\varpi^n x \in \varpi R</m> and so <m>\varpi^{n-1} x \in R</m>, a contradiction.
          Hence <m>n=0</m> and <m>x \in R</m>, as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose that the given conditions hold.
          It will suffice to show that the kernel of <m>\theta_R</m> is principal, as then we can apply
          <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract"/>.
          We first show that the kernel of the (surjective) Frobenius map <m>R/p \to R/p</m> is generated by <m>\varpi</m>.
          Given <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p \in pR</m>, write <m>x^p = \varpi^p y</m> for some <m>y \in R</m>. 
          Then <m>(x/\varpi)^p = y \in R</m> and so <m>x \in \varpi R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Frobenius on <m>R/p</m> factors as <m>R/p \to R/\varpi \to R/p</m> where the first map is the canonical
          projection and the second map is an isomorphism. Since this composite is surjective, the image of <m>\varpi</m> in 
          <m>R/p</m> admits a compatible system of <m>p</m>-power roots <m>\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}}</m>.
          By induction on <m>n</m>, the kernel of <m>\phi^n</m> on <m>R/p</m> is generated by <m>\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}}</m>.
          Hence the kernel of <m>\overline{\theta}_R: R^\flat \to R/p</m> is generated by the element <m>\overline{\varpi}</m> of <m>R^\flat</m>
          corresponding to the coherent sequence <m>(\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}})_n</m>.
          Since both <m>W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>R</m> are <m>p</m>-torsion-free and classically <m>p</m>-complete, 
          the kernel of <m>\theta_R</m> is generated by any element of the kernel lifting <m>\overline{\varpi}</m>,
          and in particular is principal.

            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since both <m>d</m> and <m>p</m> are non-zerodivisors on <m>S'</m>,
            by <xref ref="exer-torsion-exchange"/> we have <m>(S'/(d))[p] \cong (S'/(p))[d] = (R^\flat/J')[d]</m>.
            The latter vanishes because the element <m>d = a_0</m> of <m>R^\flat/J'</m> is a non-zerodivisor (by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>).
            We deduce that <m>S'/(d)</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, and so the surjection <m>R \to S'</m> from the top row factors through
            <m>R/R[p^\infty] = S</m>. As in the previous paragraph, we may identify the bottom right entry with <m>S'/\sqrt{pS'}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>K</m> be the kernel of <m>R \to S'</m>. Since <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt-mod-d"/> is a pullback square,
            <m>K</m> embeds into <m>W(R^\flat)/J)/d = \overline{R}</m> and hence is <m>p</m>-torsion. Hence <m>K \subseteq R[p^\infty]</m>
            and so the induced map <m>R/R[p^\infty] = S \to S'</m> is injective. Since it is also surjective (because <m>R \to S'</m> is) it is an isomorphism;
            this proves that <xref ref="fig-lens-double-square"/> and <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt-mod-d"/> are the same square,
            and hence the former is a pullback square.
          </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, note that the first numbered assertion is included in <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>; the second and third assertions follow from
          the fact that <xref ref="fig-lens-double-square"/> is now a pullback square; and these in turn imply that the square is a pushout.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Any lens is a reduced ring.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="prop-structure-of-untilts"/>, we may reduce to the cases of a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m> and of a <m>p</m>-torsion-free untilted ring.
          In the former case, it is evident that any perfect ring is reduced. in the latter case, let <m>R</m> be the lens in question. 
          Apply <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> to choose an element <m>\varpi \in R</m> such that <m>\varpi^p = pu</m> for some unit <m>u \in R^\times</m>.
          It will suffice to check that any <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p = 0</m> vanishes, or (because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-adically separated)
          that any such <m>x</m> is divisible by <m>\varpi^n</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>. We prove this by induction starting with the base case <m>n=0</m>.
          Given that <m>x = \pi^n y</m> for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m> and some <m>y \in R</m>, we have <m>\varpi^{np} y^p = 0</m> and hence
          <m>y^p = 0</m> because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. By <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> again, the kernel of the Frobenius on <m>R/p</m> is
          generated by <m>\varpi</m>; hence <m>y \in \varpi R</m> and <m>x \in \varpi^{n+1} R</m>.

          One approach is to use the theorem of Ax-Sen-Tate (see <xref ref="bib-Ax"/>); this implies for example that if <m>K</m> is a (possibly infinite) Galois algebraic extension
          of <m>\QQ_p</m> with Galois group <m>G</m>, then the invariant subfield of the completion of <m>K</m> under the action of <m>G</m> is equal to <m>\QQ_p</m>.
