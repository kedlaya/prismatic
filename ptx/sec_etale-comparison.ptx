        In this section, we establish the étale comparison theorem for prismatic cohomology (<xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>). 
        The strategy is to use arc-descent to reduce to a case where
        everything can be calculated explicitly; this avoids any use of analytic geometry.

    <title>The Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</title>
    <p>
      Our entire discussion up to now has involved cohomology theores of <q>coherent nature</q>, involving some sort of algebro-geometric structure sheaf.
      It is reasonable to wonder how then we can hope to say anything meaningful about étale cohomology.
      The fundamental bridge between these two words is the <term>Artin-Schreier exact sequence</term>, or in a more general form the <term>Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</term>.
      (See <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 0A3J for more discussion.)

      <title>Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any scheme <m>X</m> over <m>\FF_p</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \underline{\FF}_p \to \GG_a \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} \GG_a \to 0
          </me>
          of étale sheaves on <m>X</m> is exact. More generally, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \underline{\ZZ/p^n \ZZ} \to W_n \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} W_n \to 0
          </me>
          of étale sheaves on <m>X</m> is exact (where <m>W_n</m> denotes <m>p</m>-typical Witt vectors of rank <m>n</m>, viewed as a group scheme with respect to addition).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The key point is the surjectivity of <m>\phi - 1</m>.
          To check this, we may assume <m>X = \Spec A</m> is affine. It will suffice to check that for <m>x = (x_0,\dots,x_{n-1}) \in W_n(A)</m>, the morphism
          <me>
            A \to B = A[y_0,\dots,y_{n-1}]/((\varphi-1)y - x)
          </me>
          is étale (and even finite étale).
          The defining ideal is generated by some elements of the form
          <me>
            y_i^p - y_i - P(x_0,\dots,x_i,y_0,\dots,y_{i-1}) \qquad (i=0,\dots,n-1);
          </me>
          we may thus deduce that <m>A \to B</m> is finite étale using the Jacobian criterion (the Jacobian matrix is triangular with units on the diagonal).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The Artin-Schreier-Witt sequence also has a nonabelian analogue; this appears in Fontaine's theory of <term><m>(\varphi, \Gamma)</m>-modules</term>

    <title>Frobenius fixed points and completions</title>
    <p>
      The Artin-Schreier exact sequence leads us to the following considerations.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-frobenius-fixed-points">
      <p>
        Fix an <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra <m>B</m> and an element <m>t \in B</m>. Write <m>D_{\comp}(B)</m> for the <m>t</m>-complete derived category of <m>B</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>D(B[F])</m> be the <term>derived category of Frobenius <m>B</m>-modules</term>; objects in this category are pairs <m>(M, \phi)</m> where <m>M \in D(B)</m>
        and <m>\phi: M \to \phi_* M</m> is a morphism. Let <m>D_{\comp}(B[F])</m> be the full subcategory of <m>D(B[F])</m> spanned by pairs <m>(M, \phi)</m>
        with <m>D \in D_{\comp}(B)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given <m>(M, \phi) \in D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>, define
        <me>
          M^{\phi=1} = \Cone(M \stackrel{\phi-1}{\to} M) = R\Hom_{D(B[F])}((B, \phi), (M, \phi)).

        We call this object the <term>Frobenius fixed points</term> of <m>M</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-phi-invariants-mod-t">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-frobenius-fixed-points"/>,
          for any <m>(N, \phi) \in D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>, the map <m>N^{\phi=1} \to (N/t)^{\phi=1}</m> is an isomorphism.
          (Here the <m>\phi</m>-structure on <m>N/t</m> is the one induced from <m>N</m> using the fact that <m>\phi(t) = t^p \in tB</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>N</m> is derived <m>t</m>-complete, then the cone <m>F</m> of <m>N \to N/t</m> is complete for the <m>t</m>-adic filtration, and the <m>\phi</m>-action
          is topologically nilpotent because <m>\phi(t) = t^p \in t^2 B</m>. From this we see that <m>F^{\phi=1} = 0</m>, proving the claim.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-fixed-points">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-frobenius-fixed-points"/>, the following statements hold.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The functors <m>D_{\comp}(B[F]) \to D(\FF_p)</m> given by <m>M \mapsto M^{\phi=1}</m> and <m>M \mapsto (M[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}</m> commute with sequential colimits.
              (In the realm of <m>\infty</m>-categories, this can be upgraded to arbitrary colimits.)

              </me>
              the natural maps
              <me>
                M^{\phi=1} \to N^{\phi=1}, \qquad (M[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1} \to (N[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}
              </me>
              are isomorphisms.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For convenience, we take colimits in the ambient category <m>D(B)</m> (in contrast to the original statement).
        </p>
        <p>
          For (1), we first verify tha tthe two assertions are equivalent.
          Consider a diagram <m>\{(M_i, \phi_i)\}</m> in <m>D_{\comp}(B[F])</m>. Let <m>F</m> be the cone of the map from <m>\colim_i M_i</m> to its derived <m>t</m>-completion;
          note that <m>F</m> is uniquely <m>t</m>-divisible, so <m>F</m> is also the cone of the map obtained after inverting <m>t</m> on both sides.
          Now both statements of the lemma are equivalent to the vanishing of <m>F^{\phi=1}</m>, and hence to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now prove that <m>M \mapsto M^{\phi=1}</m> commutes with colimits. By <xref ref="lem-phi-invariants-mod-t"/>, this functor refactors as
          <me>
            D_{\comp}(B[F]) \stackrel{N \mapsto N/t}{\to} D(B[F]) \stackrel{\bullet^{\phi=1}}{\to} D(\FF_p)
          </me>
          and both factors commute with colimits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For (2), using (1) it suffices to check that each map <m>(M, \phi) \stackrel{\phi}{\to} (M, \phi)</m> induces an isomorphism
          upon applying either <m>\bullet^{\phi=1}</m> or <m>(\bullet[t^{-1}])^{\phi=1}</m>, both of which are clear.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-etale-comparison">
      <title>Étale comparison theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be a perfect prism and choose a generator <m>d</m> of <m>I</m> (<xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>).
          Let <m>R</m> be a derived <m>p</m>-complete <m>\overline{A}</m>-algebra. Then for each positive integer <m>n</m>, there is a canonical identification
          <men xml:id="eq-etale-comparison">
            R\Gamma_{\et}(\Spec R[p^{-1}], \underline{\ZZ/p^n}) \cong (\Prism_{R/A}[d^{-1}]/p^n)^{\phi=1}

          (in the sense of <xref ref="def-frobenius-fixed-points"/>). In particular, the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> depends only on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We will show that both sides of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> admits descent for the arc-topology.
          For the left-hand side, this will be <xref ref="thm-arc-descent-etale"/>.
          For the right-hand side, we first observe that
          <me>
            (\Prism_{R/A}[d^{-1}]/p^n)^{\phi=1} \to (\Prism_{R/A,\perf}[d^{-1}]/p^n)^{\phi=1}
          </me>
          is a quasi-isomorphism: it suffices to check this for <m>n=1</m>, in which case this follows from <xref ref="cor-fixed-points"/>.
          The descent assertion then follows from <xref ref="thm-arc-descent-lens"/> (compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Corollary 8.10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using arc-descent and the Artin-Schreier-Witt exact sequence (<xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/>), we obtain a map (from left to right in <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/>) of the desired form.
          To check that it is an isomorphism, we may apply arc-descent again: using a v-covering as in <xref ref="exa-v-cover"/>, we may reduce to a case where
          <m>R = \prod_i R_i</m> is a product of <m>p</m>-complete AIC valuation rings (and in particular a lens, by <xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>).
          In this case, the left-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> equals <m>(ZZ/p^n)^I</m> concentrated in degree 0.
          As for the right-hand side, we have that <m>\Prism_{R/A,perf} \cong W(R^\flat)</m> concentrated in degree <m>0</m> (<xref ref="exa-coperfection-lens"/>),
          so it will suffice to check that for each <m>i \in I</m>, <m>\phi-1</m> is surjective on <m>W(R_i^\flat[d^{-1}])/p^n</m> with kernel <m>\ZZ/p^n</m>.
          This will follow from <xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/> once we verify that <m>R_i^\flat</m> is algebraically closed (<xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        As per <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, Remark 9.3, we point out that a similar method can be used to obtain a (somewhat less interesting) variant of <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/> 
        without inverting <m>p</m> or <m>d</m>: there is a canonical identification of étale sheaves
          <me>
            \underline{\ZZ/p^n} \cong (\Prism_{R/A}/p^n)^{\phi=1}.

    <title>Tilting of valuation rings</title>
    <p>
      As an application of <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>, we prove the converse of <xref ref="lem-aic-tilt"/> and recover the tilting correspondence for perfectoid fields
      (<xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/>).
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="prop-aic-tilt">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a lens. Then <m>V</m> is an AIC valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-lens"/>, <m>V</m> is a valuation ring if and only if <m>V^\flat</m> is; it thus remains to show that if <m>V^\flat</m> is AIC,
          then so is <m>V</m>. So suppose by way of contradiction that <m>V</m> is not AIC.
          By <xref ref="lem-valuation-ring-tilt-value-group"/>, <m>V</m> and <m>V^\flat</m> have the same (algebraically closed) residue field and the same (divisible) value group.
          Consequently, any nontrivial finite Galois extension of <m>\Frac V</m> is totally wildly ramified and so has Galois group which is a <m>p</m>-group.
          This in turn implies that <m>\Frac V</m> admits a nontrivial <m>\ZZ/p\ZZ</m>-extension, and so <m>H^1(\Spec V[p^{-1}], \underline{\FF_p}) \neq 0</m>.
          However, this contradicts <xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>: the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq-etale-comparison"/> vanishes by 
          <xref ref="prop-artin-schreier-witt"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-perfectoid-correspondence-derivation">
      <p>
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> can be used to recover the tilting correspondence for perfectoid fields (<xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/>) as follows.
        Let <m>K</m> be a perfectoid field and let <m>L</m> be a completed algebraic closure of <m>K</m>.
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> implies that <m>L^\flat</m> is an algebraically closed extension of <m>K^\flat</m>, so it contains a completed algebraic closure <m>M</m> of <m>K^\flat</m>.
        Each finite subextension of <m>M</m> over <m>K^\flat</m> untilts to a finite extension of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m> which is perfectoid.
        The completed union of these extensions is an untilt of <m>M</m>, so by <xref ref="lem-aic-tilt"/> this untilt is algebraically closed.
        In particular it contains the integral closure of <m>K</m> in <m>L</m>, and so by completeness it equals <m>L</m>; in other words, <m>M = L^\flat</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>P \in K[x]</m> be an irreducible polynomial with roots <m>\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n \in L</m>. By the previous paragraph, we can find a finite Galois perfectoid extension <m>K'</m> of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m>
        and an element <m>\beta \in L</m> such that <m>|\beta-\alpha_1| &lt; |\alpha_i - \alpha_1|</m> for <m>i=2,\dots,n</m>. By Krasner's lemma, we have <m>\beta \in K'</m>; it follows that every finite extension
        of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m> is contained in a finite Galois perfectoid extension of <m>K</m> within <m>L</m>. Using the Galois correspondence, we deduce that every finite extension of <m>K</m> is the untilt of some
        finite extension of <m>K^\flat</m> within <m>L^\flat</m>, and so is perfectoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        This argument is essentially the proof of <xref ref="thm-field-of-norms"/> given in <xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Theorem 1.5.6 except that therein, 
        <xref ref="prop-aic-tilt"/> is proved by an explicit computation (<xref ref="bib-Kedlaya-new-methods"/>, Lemma 1.5.4). The novelty here is that arc-descent allows us to deduce this from the much more basic
        statement that <m>V</m> can be extended to an AIC valuation ring, which is then automatically a lens (<xref ref="lem-aic-p-complete-lens"/>).

          By <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the morphism <m>\frako_\CC \to k</m> lifts to a unique morphism <m>(A,I) \to (W,(p))</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conflate the underlying spaces of the formal scheme <m>X</m> and the ordinary scheme <m>X_k</m>; on this space, we may define prismatic cohomology complexes of sheaves <m>\Prism_{X/A}</m>
          and <m>\Prism_{X_k/W}</m>. By the Hodge-Tate comparison (<xref ref="thm-hodge-tate-comparison"/>) and its compatibility with base change (<xref ref="lem-prismatic-base-change"/>), we have
          <men xml:id="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison3">
            \Prism_{X/A} \widehat{\otimes}^L_A W \cong \Prism_{X_k/W}
          </men>
          (with the completion being <m>p</m>-adic).
        </p>
        <p>
          Define 
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) = R\Gamma(X, \Prism_{X/A}) \in D(A).
          </me>
          Since <m>R\Gamma(X, \bullet)</m> preserves limits, <m>R \Gamma_A(X)</m> is a derived <m>(p,I)</m>-complete object of <m>D(A)</m>. By the Hodge-Tate comparison and the usual finiteness property of coherent
          cohomology on a proper scheme (<xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 02O5), <m>R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \frako_\CC</m> is a perfect complex of <m>\frako_\CC</m>-modules. By derived Nakayama (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>)
          applied to suitable truncations, we deduce that <m>R \Gamma_A(X)</m> is a perfect complex of <m>A</m>-modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, <m>R \Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L V</m> is a perfect complex of <m>V</m>-modules.
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-complex-semicontinuity"/>, we obtain
          <men xml:id="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2">
            \dim_{\CC^\flat} H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat) \leq \dim_k H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L k).
          </men>
          We will deduce <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> by comparing its terms with <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first check that the right-hand sides of <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> and <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/> coincide. 
          From <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison3"/> we obtain
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) \widehat{\otimes}_A^L W \cong R \Gamma_W(X_k).
          </me>
          Reduce  modulo <m>p</m> (which gets rid of the completion) and applying the crystalline comparison theorem (<xref ref="cor-prismatic-to-crystalline"/>) yields
          <me>
            R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L k \cong R\Gamma_W(X_k) \otimes_W^L k \cong \phi_* R\Gamma_{\dR}(X_k/k).
          </me>
          Since <m>k</m> is perfect, the Frobenius twist <m>\phi_*</m> has no effect on <m>k</m>-dimensions; we thus deduce the desired equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that the left-hand sides of <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison1"/> and <xref ref="eq-torsion-cohom-comparison2"/> satisfy
          <me>
            \dim_{\FF_p} H^i_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \leq \dim_{\CC^\flat} H^i(R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat)
          </me>
          (in fact equality will hold as perf <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture IX, Remark 5.3, but this will suffice for now).
          Apply the étale comparison theorem (<xref ref="thm-etale-comparison"/>) to the terms of an open affine cover of <m>X</m> to obtain an identification
          <me>
            R\Gamma_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \cong (R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat)^{\phi=1},
          </me>
          then apply <xref ref="lem-phi-invariants"/> to obtain for each <m>i</m> an injective linear map
          <me>
            H^i_{\et}(X_\eta, \FF_p) \otimes_{\FF_p} \CC^\flat \to H^i( R\Gamma_A(X) \otimes_A^L \CC^\flat).
          </me>
          This yields the desired inequality.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture IX, Theorem 5.1.)
