        <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture IV. The theory of perfectoid fields, rings, and spaces has been described in numerous sources;

      In <xref ref="sec_perfect"/>, we showed that a perfect prism <m>(A, I)</m> can be recovered from the ring <m>\overline{A} = A/I</m>.
      Here, we study the rings of this form in more detail. These end up being closely related to <term>perfectoid rings</term>,
      which appear frequently in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory; however, we will not use too much of the existing theory of perfectoid rings, and in fact we will end
      up recovering some of it via a different approach.

    <title>The category of lenses</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>lens</term> is a ring which occurs as the slice of some perfect prism.
        We define the category of lenses to be the full subcategory of <m>\Ring</m> consisting of lenses;
        by <xref ref="thm-untilting-functor"/>, the slice functor from perfect prisms to lenses is an equivalence of categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>\overline{A} =  A/I</m> a lens, we say that <m>\overline{A}</m> is an <term>untilt</term> of <m>\overline{A}^\flat</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        For any perfect ring <m>R</m> of characteristic <m>p</m>, the pair <m>(W(R), (p))</m> is a perfect prism with slice and tilt both equal to <m>R</m>.
        In particular, <m>R</m> is a lens.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be the <m>t</m>-adic completion of <m>\FF_p[t^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> and put <m>A = W(R)</m>.
        We can construct multiple perfect prisms <m>(A, I)</m> with tilt <m>R</m>, such as the following.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} [t+1]^i</m>. The lens <m>A/I</m> is isomorphic to the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[\mu_{p^\infty}]</m>
              via a map with <m>[t+1]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto \zeta_{p^n}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is isomorphic to the prism from <xref ref="exa-Ainf-prism"/>
              and is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-q-de-Rham-prism"/>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d = p - [t]</m>. The lens <m>A/I</m> is isomorphic to the <m>p</m>-adic completion of <m>\ZZ_p[p^{p^{-\infty}}]</m> via a map with
              <m>[t]^{p^{-n}} \mapsto p^{p^{-n}}</m>. The prism <m>(A,I)</m> is the coperfection of the prism from <xref ref="exa-Breuil-Kisin-prism"/> in the special case
              <m>K = \QQ_p, \pi = p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While the terminology of <term>tilting</term> and <term>untilting</term> is now quite commonly used, 
        our references to the <term>category of lenses</term> is highly nonstandard; in <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze1"/> and <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-Scholze"/>, 
        objects of this category are called <term>perfectoid rings</term>.
        However, that usage is incompatible with most prior literature; in older terminology these would be <term>integral perfectoid rings</term>.
        To minimize confusion, we sidestep this issue by using a nonce terminology based on the metaphor of prisms.

    <title>On the structure of lenses</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A ring <m>R</m> of characteristic <m>p</m> is <term>semiperfect</term> if the Frobenius automorphism of <m>R</m> is surjective.
        Note that <m>R</m> is perfect if and only if it is both reduced and semiperfect.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        A basic example of a semiperfect ring that is not perfect is the ring <m>\FF_p[t^{p^{-\infty}}]/(t)</m>.

              There exists an element <m>\varpi \in R</m> admitting a compatible system <m>\varpi^{1/p^n}</m> of <m>p</m>-power roots,

              (It is also flat as an <m>R</m>-module; see <xref ref="lem-refract-almost-ideal-flat"/>.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We have <m>R[p] = R[\sqrt{pR}]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A, I)</m> be the perfect prism with <m>A/I \cong R</m> and let <m>R^\flat</m> be the tilt.
          Then <m>R^\flat</m> is perfect and <m>R/p \cong R^\flat/p</m>, so <m>R/p</m> is semiperfect. This proves (1).
        </p>
        <p>
          For (2), apply <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> to write <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d \in A</m> a distinguished element.
          By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>, we have <m>d = [a_0] - pu</m> for some <m>a_0 \in R^\flat</m> and some unit <m>u \in A^\times</m>.
          We may then take <m>\varpi</m> to be the image of <m>[a_0]</m> to obtain (2).
        </p>
        <p>
          To check (3), we show that <m>\sqrt{pR} = \bigcup_n (\varpi^{p^{-n}})</m>. Since the left side contains the right side,
          it suffices to observe that the quotient <m>\overline{R} = R / \bigcup_n (\varpi^{p^{-n}})</m> is itself perfect, and hence reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check (4), keep notation as above; it suffices to check that <m>R[p]</m> is killed by <m>[a_0^{p^{-n}}]</m> for each <m>n</m>
          (since these elements generate <m>\sqrt{pR}</m>). To show that <m>R[p]</m> is killed by <m>[a_0^{p^{-n}}]</m> for some particular <m>n</m>,
          note that neither <m>p</m> nor <m>d</m> is a zerodivisor in <m>A</m> (by <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>
          and <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>), so we may write 
          <me>
            R[p] = (A/d)[p] = (A/p)[d] = R^\flat[d]
          </me> 
          (see <xref ref="exer-torsion-exchange"/>). By <xref ref="lem-perfect-derived-completion"/>, 
          the latter is annihilated by <m>[a_0^{p^{-n}}]</m>, as claimed.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-course"/>, Lecture IV, Lemma 2.6.)
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-refract-almost-ideal-flat">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>, the ideal <m>\sqrt{pR}</m> is a flat <m>R</m>-module.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We must check that for any <m>M \in \Mod_R</m>, <m>\Tor_i^R(M, \sqrt{pR}) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 0</m>, 
          or equivalently <m>\Tor_i^R(M, \overline{R}) = 0</m> for all <m>i \gt 1</m>.
          By tensoring <m>M</m> with the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to \Tor_1^{\ZZ_p}(M, \QQ_p) \to M \to M \otimes_{\ZZ_p} \QQ_p \to M \otimes_{\ZZ_p} \QQ_p/\ZZ_p \to 0
          </me>
          and using the fact that <m>\overline{R} \otimes_{\ZZ_p} \QQ_p = 0</m>, we may further reduce to the case of a
          module <m>M</m> which is <m>p^\infty</m>-power torsion. By the compatibility of tensor products with colimits,
          we may reduce to the case of a module which is killed by some power of <m>p</m>;
          by devissage, we may further reduce to the case where <m>M</m> is killed by <m>p</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>d</m> is a non-zerodivisor in both <m>W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>W(\overline{R})</m> (<xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>),
          <me>
            \Tor_i^R(M, \overline{R}) = \Tor_i^{W(R^\flat)}(M, W(\overline{R})).
          </me>
          Similarly, since <m>p</m> is a non-zerodivisor in both <m>W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>W(\overline{R})</m> and <m>pM = 0</m>,
          <me>
            \Tor_i^{W(R^\flat)}(M, W(\overline{R})) = \Tor_i^{R^\flat}(M, \overline{R}).
          </me>
          By <xref ref="exer-perfect-tor1"/>, <m>\overline{R} \in \Mod_{R^\flat}</m> has Tor-dimension at most 1, proving the claim.

      We can now give an intrinsic characterization of lenses, without reference to perfect prisms.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-conditions-on-refract">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A commutative ring <m>R</m> is a lens if and only if the following conditions hold.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The ring <m>R</m> is classically <m>p</m>-complete and and <m>R/p</m> is semiperfect.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The kernel of the map <m>\theta_R: W(R^\flat) \to R</m> is principal. (Recall that <m>R^\flat = \lim_\phi R/p</m>.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There exists some <m>\varpi \in R</m> such that <m>\varpi^p = pu</m> for some unit <m>u \in R</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>R = A/I</m> is a lens, then all of the stated conditions follow directly from 
          <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> and <m>R/p</m> is semiperfect by <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>.
          Conversely, suppose that these conditions hold; we will show that
          for <m>A = W(R^\flat), I = \ker(\theta_R)</m>,
          the pair <m>(A,I)</m> is a perfect prism with <m>A/I \cong R</m>.
          Since <m>\theta_R</m> induces a surjective map mod <m>p</m>,
          it is in fact surjective, so <m>A/I \cong R</m>. The ring <m>A</m> is classically <m>p</m>-complete;
          we may check that it is classically <m>(p,I)</m>-complete 
          by checking that <m>A/p \cong R^\flat</m> is classically <m>I</m>-complete,
          which is straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, we must show that <m>I</m> admits a distinguished generator.
          To this end, choose <m>x,v \in A</m> lifting <m>\varpi,u</m> and put <m>g = pv - x^p \in \ker(I)</m>.
          The series expansion of <m>x</m> has zero coefficient of <m>p</m>; since <m>v</m> is a unit (because <m>A</m>
          is <m>I</m>-local), we deduce from <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> that <m>g</m> is distinguished.
          Since <m>I</m> is principal, we may apply <xref ref="lem-distiguished-times-unit"/> to deduce that <m>g</m> is in fact a generator.
        </p>

      In the <m>p</m>-torsion-free case we can make this description even simpler.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose first that <m>R</m> is a lens. In light of <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract"/>, we only need to check that
          <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-normal. Take <m>\varpi</m> as in <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>.
          Given <m>x \in R[p^{-1}]</m> with <m>x^p \in R</m>, let <m>n</m> be the smallest nonnegative integer such that
          <m>\varpi^n x \in R</m>. If <m>n > 0</m>, then by writing
          <me>
            (\varpi^n x)^p = \varpi^{np} x^p \in \varpi^{np} R \subset \varpi^p R
          </me>
          and using that the Frobenius map <m>R/\varpi \to R/\varpi^p</m> is a bijection, we see that
          <m>\varpi^n x \in \varpi R</m> and so <m>\varpi^{n-1} x \in R</m>, a contradiction.
          Hence <m>n=0</m> and <m>x \in R</m>, as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose that the given conditions hold.
          It will suffice to show that the kernel of <m>\theta_R</m> is principal, as then we can apply
          <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract"/>.
          We first show that the kernel of the (surjective) Frobenius map <m>R/p \to R/p</m> is generated by <m>\varpi</m>.
          Given <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p \in pR</m>, write <m>x^p = \varpi^p y</m> for some <m>y \in R</m>. 
          Then <m>(x/\varpi)^p = y \in R</m> and so <m>x \in \varpi R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Frobenius on <m>R/p</m> factors as <m>R/p \to R/\varpi \to R/p</m> where the first map is the canonical
          projection and the second map is an isomorphism. Since this composite is surjective, the image of <m>\varpi</m> in 
          <m>R/p</m> admits a compatible system of <m>p</m>-power roots <m>\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}}</m>.
          By induction on <m>n</m>, the kernel of <m>\phi^n</m> on <m>R/p</m> is generated by <m>\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}}</m>.
          Hence the kernel of <m>\overline{\theta}_R: R^\flat \to R/p</m> is generated by the element <m>\overline{\varpi}</m> of <m>R^\flat</m>
          corresponding to the coherent sequence <m>(\overline{\varpi}^{p^{-n}})_n</m>.
          Since both <m>W(R^\flat)</m> and <m>R</m> are <m>p</m>-torsion-free and classically <m>p</m>-complete, 
          the kernel of <m>\theta_R</m> is generated by any element of the kernel lifting <m>\overline{\varpi}</m>,
          and in particular is principal.

          For any perfectoid field <m>K</m>, the valuation ring <m>\frako_K</m> is a lens.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
         If <m>K</m> is of characteristic <m>p</m>, then <m>\frako_K/p=\frako_K</m> is reduced and semiperfect, hence perfect.
         We thus assume hereafter that <m>K</m> is characteristic 0; we may then check the conditions of <xref ref="prop-conditions-on-refract2"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear that <m>\frako_K</m> is classically <m>p</m>-complete and <m>p</m>-normal (since it is integrally closed),
          and by hypothesis <m>\frako_K/p</m> is semiperfect.
          Since <m>K</m> is not discretely valued, we can choose an element <m>x \in \frako_K</m> of positive valuation
          such that <m>x^p</m> divides <m>p</m>.
          Since <m>\frako_K/p</m> is semiperfect, there exists <m>y \in \frako_K</m> such that <m>y^p \equiv p/x^p \pmod{p}</m>;
          put <m>\varpi = xy</m>. Then <m>\varpi^p/p \equiv 1 \pmod{x^p}</m> and so <m>u = \varpi^p/p</m> is a unit in 
          <m>\frako_K</m>.

    <title>Glueing of lenses</title>
    <p>
      Most familiar examples of lenses are either <m>p</m>-torsion-free or of characteristic <m>p</m>. We can prove a result that shows that this accounts for
      all possibilities up to a <q>glueing</q> construction.

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a perfect <m>\FF_p</m>-algebra. Let <m>J</m> be a radical ideal of <m>R</m> and let <m>J' = R[J]</m>.
          Then <m>J'</m> and <m>J+J'</m> are both radical ideals and the square in <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square"/>
          is both a pullback square and a pushout square of commutative rings.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first check that <m>J'</m> is radical. If <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p \in J'</m>, then <m>x^p J = 0</m>; since <m>R</m> is perfect,
          it follows that <m>xJ = 0</m> and so <m>x \in J'</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that <m>J+J'</m> is radical. The ideal <m>J+J'</m> is the kernel of <m>R \to R/J \otimes_R R/J'</m>; the target is a colimit of perfect rings and hence
          is itself perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The square in question is already a pushout square at the level of groups, hence also at the level of rings. To check that it is a pullback square, we must check 
          that <m>J \cap J' = 0</m>. To this end, choose <m>x \in J \cap J'</m>; since <m>x \in J'</m> we have <m>xJ = 0</m>, but since <m>x \in J</m> this implies <m>x^2 = 0</m>
          and finally <m>x = 0</m> because <m>R</m> is perfect.

      <proof>

          We first show that the square is a pullback. 
          By <xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/> we can write
          <m>I = (d)</m> with <m>d</m> distinguished. By <xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/> we can write
          <m>d = [a_0] - pu</m> with <m>a_0 \in R^\flat</m>, <m>u \in A^\times</m>.
          Consider the perfect ideals <m>J = (a_0^{p^{-\infty}})</m> and <m>J' = R^\flat[J]</m> of the perfect ring <m>R^\flat</m>. The square
          <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt"/> consists of <m>p</m>-torsion-free, <m>p</m>-adically complete rings and its reduction modulo <m>p</m>
          is the pullback square from <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square"/>; hence by devissage it is a pullback square.

            We now show that <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt-mod-d"/> coincides with <xref ref="fig-lens-double-square"/>.
            Inside <m>W(R^\flat/J)</m> we have <m>(d) = (p)</m> since <m>a_0 \in I</m>, so by <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>,
            <me>
              W(R^\flat/J)/d = R^\flat/J = R^\flat/(a_0^{p^{-\infty}}) \cong \overline{R}.
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since both <m>d</m> and <m>p</m> are non-zerodivisors on <m>S'</m>,
            by <xref ref="exer-torsion-exchange"/> we have <m>(S'/(d))[p] \cong (S'/(p))[d] = (R^\flat/J')[d]</m>.
            The latter vanishes because the element <m>d = a_0</m> of <m>R^\flat/J'</m> is a non-zerodivisor (by <xref ref="lem-bounded-torsion-derived-complete"/>).
            We deduce that <m>S'/(d)</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, and so the surjection <m>R \to S'</m> from the top row factors through
            <m>R/R[p^\infty] = S</m>. As in the previous paragraph, we may identify the bottom right entry with <m>S'/\sqrt{pS'}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>K</m> be the kernel of <m>R \to S'</m>. Since <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt-mod-d"/> is a pullback square,
            <m>K</m> embeds into <m>W(R^\flat)/J)/d = \overline{R}</m> and hence is <m>p</m>-torsion. Hence <m>K \subseteq R[p^\infty]</m>
            and so the induced map <m>R/R[p^\infty] = S \to S'</m> is injective. Since it is also surjective (because <m>R \to S'</m> is) it is an isomorphism;
            this proves that <xref ref="fig-lens-double-square"/> and <xref ref="fig-perfect-double-square-Witt-mod-d"/> are the same square,
            and hence the former is a pullback square.
          </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, note that the first numbered assertion is included in <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/>; the second and third assertions follow from
          the fact that <xref ref="fig-lens-double-square"/> is now a pullback square; and these in turn imply that the square is a pushout.

          By <xref ref="prop-structure-of-untilts"/>, we may reduce to the cases of a perfect ring of characteristic <m>p</m> and of a <m>p</m>-torsion-free untilted ring.
          In the former case, it is evident that any perfect ring is reduced. in the latter case, let <m>R</m> be the lens in question. 
          Apply <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> to choose an element <m>\varpi \in R</m> such that <m>\varpi^p = pu</m> for some unit <m>u \in R^\times</m>.
          It will suffice to check that any <m>x \in R</m> with <m>x^p = 0</m> vanishes, or (because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-adically separated)
          that any such <m>x</m> is divisible by <m>\varpi^n</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>. We prove this by induction starting with the base case <m>n=0</m>.
          Given that <m>x = \pi^n y</m> for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m> and some <m>y \in R</m>, we have <m>\varpi^{np} y^p = 0</m> and hence
          <m>y^p = 0</m> because <m>R</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free. By <xref ref="lem-refract-properties"/> again, the kernel of the Frobenius on <m>R/p</m> is
          generated by <m>\varpi</m>; hence <m>y \in \varpi R</m> and <m>x \in \varpi^{n+1} R</m>.
