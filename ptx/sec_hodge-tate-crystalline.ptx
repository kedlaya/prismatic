      In this section, we prove the Hodge-Tate comparison theorem (<xref ref="thm-hodge-tate-comparison"/>) in the special case where the base prism
      <m>(A,I)</m> is crystalline (meaning that <m>I = (p)</m>) and the ring <m>R</m> is a polynomial ring over <m>\overline{A} = A/p</m>.
      This simultaneously shows off some key ideas and provides a crucial base case for the general argument.

    <title>de Rham cohomology in characteristic <m>p</m></title>
    <p>
      We first recall how de Rham cohomology works in characteristic <m>p</m>, focusing on the key case of an affine space (polynomial ring).
      The key point is that even in this case the cohomology is quite large, and in fact the cohomology groups reflect the structure of the original complex
      via the <term>Cartier isomorphism</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          For any morphism <m>R \to S</m> in <m>\Ring_{\FF_p}</m>, the map <m>\phi_S: \Omega^i_{S/R} \to \Omega^i_{S/R}</m> is zero for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          For any morphism <m>R \to S</m> in <m>\Ring_{\FF_p}</m>, the map <m>\phi_{S/R}: \Omega^i_{S^{(1)}/R} \to \Omega^i_{S/R}</m> is zero for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It suffices to check the claim for <m>i = 1</m>. Moreover, we may assume <m>S = R[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m>, as we may then take colimits to deduce the case where <m>S</m>
          is a polynomial ring in any number of variables, and then take quotients to deduce the case where <m>S</m> is arbitrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>S = R[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m>, we may identify <m>S^{(1)}</m> with a second copy of <m>R[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m> with the map
          <m>S^{(1)} \to S</m> being given by the <m>R</m>-linear substitution <m>x_i \mapsto x_i^p</m>. In particular,
          <m>\phi_{S/R}(dx_i) = d(x_i^p) = 0</m> as per <xref ref="lem-frobenius-on-de-rham"/>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        As indicated in <xref ref="fig-relative-Frobenius"/>, the construction of relative Frobenius extends to an arbitrary morphism of schemes <m>f: Y \to X</m>
        in characteristic <m>p</m>. The example of a polynomial ring, and its description in the proof of <xref ref="cor-relative-frobenius-de-rham"/>,
        may be misleading: in general <m>Y</m> and <m>Y^{(1)}</m> will not be isomorphic over <m>X</m>.
        For example, if <m>X</m> is the spectrum of an algebraically closed field <m>k</m>
        and <m>Y</m> is an elliptic curve over <m>k</m>, then the <m>j</m>-invariants <m>j(Y)</m> and <m>j(Y^{(1)})</m> will differ in general (the latter being the image of the
        former under <m>\phi_k</m>).

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The map <m>\phi_{S/R}</m> induces a morphism of complexes thanks to <xref ref="cor-relative-frobenius-de-rham"/>. 
          To check that this map is a quasi-isomorphism, we form a decomposition
          <men xml:id="eq-cartier-splitting">
            \Omega^i_{S/R} = \bigoplus_{e_1,\dots,e_r \in \{0,\dots,p-1\}} \bigoplus_{1 \leq j_1 \lt \cdots \lt j_i \leq r} x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_r^{e_r} 
            S^{(1)} dx_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j_i}.
          </men>
          We obtain a morphism <m>(\Omega^\bullet_{S/R}, d_{\dR}) \to (\Omega^\bullet_{S^{(1)}/R}, 0)</m> of complexes (not respecting the multiplicative structure)
          taking <m>x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_r^{e_r} dx_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j_i}</m> to <m>dx_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j_i}</m> for
          <me>
            e_j = \begin{cases} p-1 &amp; j \in \{j_1,\dots,j_i\} \\ 0 &amp; j \notin \{j_1,\dots,j_i\} \end{cases}.
          </me>
          We must show that the composition of these maps is homotopic to the identity on <m>\Omega^\bullet_{S/R}</m>.
          By proceeding by induction, we may reduce to the case <m>r=1</m>. In this case, for <m>e_1 = 1,\dots,p-1</m>, <m>d_{\dR}</m> maps
          <m>x_1^{e_1} S^{(1)}</m> to <m>x_1^{e_1-1} S^{(1)}\,dx_1</m> taking <m>x_1^{e_1} f</m> to <m>e_1 x_1^{e_1-1} f\,dx</m>,
          and this map is evidently invertible.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While the Cartier map described in <xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/> is defined in terms of coordinates on the polynomial ring <m>S</m>,
        the construction is <em>canonical up to homotopy</em> in that the resulting map in <m>D(S^{(1)})</m> is well-defined
        independently of the way that <m>S</m> is expresesd as a polynomial ring. 
        For example, making the change of variables <m>x_1 \mapsto x_1 + x_2</m> does not change the map because
        <me>
          (x_1+x_2)^{p-1}\,d(x_1 + x_2) - x_1^{p-1}\,dx_1 - x_2^{p-2} \,dx_2 = \sum_{i=1}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{i} x_1^i x_2^{p_1-i} (dx_1 + dx_2)
        </me>
        contributes only to summands in <xref ref="eq-cartier-splitting"/> that get killed off by the homotopy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet another construction can be given (for <m>R = \FF_p</m>, then deducing the general case by base change) by lifting from <m>\FF_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>
        to <m>\ZZ_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>. Given an element <m>f \in \ZZ_p[x_1^p,\dots,x_r^p]</m> lifting <m>\overline{f} \in \FF_p[x_1^p,\dots,x_r^p] \cong S^{(1)}</m>,
        the element <m>p^{-1} df</m> reduces to an element of <m>\Omega^1_{S/R}</m> independent of the choice of <m>f</m>, and this is the image of <m>d\overline{f}</m>
        under the Cartier map.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last construction is quite similar to how the Cartier isomorphism will appear in the proof of the Hodge-Tate comparison for crystalline prisms
        (<xref ref="thm-Hodge-Tate-crystalline-affine-space"/>). In fact that result will itself establish the canonicality of the Cartier isomorphism, so we don't need to worry
        much about it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, once canonicality is established by some means, we can easily promote <xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/> to a similar statement for any smooth morphism <m>R \to S</m> in <m>\Ring_{\FF_p}</m>.
        We omit the details here, as we will see the same argument again soon (<xref ref="lem-hodge-tate-etale-base-change"/>).

        <xref ref="prop-poincare-lemma"/> amounts to the computation of the <term>crystalline cohomology</term> of a point.
        We will see in <xref ref="prismatic-cohomology-crystalline"/> that the proof of the Hodge-Tate comparison isomorphism 
        for a crystalline prism naturally passes through crystalline cohomology.
      </p>
      <p>
        One potentially confusing point is that unlike de Rham cohomology in characteristic 0, 
        the crystalline cohomology of a higher-dimensional affine space is not the same as that of a point!
        In fact, the crystalline cohomology of <m>\Spec \FF_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>
        is computed by the complex <m>\widehat{\Omega}^{\bullet}_{P/\ZZ_p}</m> where <m>P = \ZZ_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]^\wedge_{(p)}</m> 
        (this ring already admits divided powers on <m>(p)</m> by <xref ref="exa-Zp-divided-powers"/>);
        taking the derived base change from <m>\ZZ_p</m> to <m>\FF_p</m> yields <m>\Omega_{R/\FF_p}</m>,
        whose cohomology we already know is quite large (<xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/>).
        What <xref ref="prop-poincare-lemma"/> tells us is that the answer does not change if we include some extra <q>divided power variables</q>;
        see <xref ref="prop-crystalline-cohomology-affine-space"/> for a concrete statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, none of this has much meaning without an actual definition of crystalline cohomology itself.

          Let <m>D</m> be the divided power envelope; it is the smallest subring of <m>\ZZ_{(p)}\{x\}[p^{-1}]</m>

          The maximal ideal on which <m>D</m> admits divided powers includes both <m>x</m> (by construction) and <m>p</m> (by <xref ref="exa-Zp-divided-powers"/>),
          and hence also <m>\phi(x)</m>; consequently, for all <m>n \geq 1</m>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          We may reduce to the case of a polynomial ring in finitely many variables by taking colimits.
          We may further reduce the case <m>i = 1</m> using exterior powers.
          We may further reduce to the case <m>P = \ZZ_p[x]</m> using base change and induction on the number of variables.
          At this point, we can write down the homotopy <m>h</m> explicitly: if we write the <m>(n+1)</m>-fold tensor product of <m>P</m> as <m>P^n = \ZZ[x_{n0}, \dots, x_{nn}]</m>,
          then the homotopy carries <m>\Omega^1_{P^n}</m> to <m>\Omega_{P^{n-1}}</m> taking <m>dx_{ni}</m> to <m>dx_{(n-1)i}</m> for <m>i=0,\dots,n-1</m> and to 0 for <m>i=n</m>.
          We leave it to the reader to check that <m>h</m> is a homotopy for the identity map (<xref ref="exer-differentials-derived"/>).

          each column computes the crystalline cohomology of <m>\Spec \FF_p[x_1,\dots,x_r]</m>, and for this identification each map <m>P^{n-1} \to P^n</m> represents
          the identity map on cohomology.
          Hence the horizontal differentials between the columns (which are alternating sums of the induced maps) are represented by

          as described in <xref ref="cor-crystalline-weakly-final"/>, and then obtain <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \in D(\overline{A})</m> by applying <m>\otimes^L_A A/p</m>. 
          By <xref ref="rmk-identify-prismatic-product-with-divided-powers"/>, the object <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> (or more correctly <m>\phi^*\Prism_{R/A}</m>)
          is represented by the top row of the double complex <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline"/>, which by 
          <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/> is isomorphic in <m>D(A)</m> to the first column of the double complex.
          By <xref ref="cor-prismatic-to-crystalline"/>, that column computes the crystalline cohomology of affine space.
          By applying <m>\otimes^L_{\ZZ_p} \FF_p</m>, we obtain an isomorphism
          <men xml:id="eq-prismatic-to-derham-map">
            \phi^* \overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \cong (\Omega^\bullet_{R/\FF_p}, d_{\dR})
          </men>
          of <m>\FF_p</m>-dga's which in degree <m>0</m> is the identity map on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check that <m>\eta_R</m> is an isomorphism, it will suffice to deduce from <xref ref="eq-prismatic-to-derham-map"/> that <m>\phi^*(\eta_R)</m>
          corresponds to the Cartier isomorphism; it suffices to do this in degree 1.
          As in <xref ref="def-Breuil-Kisin-twist"/>, consider the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to p T / p^2 T\to T / p^2 T \to T / p T \to 0, \qquad T = P^0\{J^0/p\}^\wedge_{(p)}.
          </me>
          Viewing the element <m>x_i \in P^0\{J^0/p\}^\wedge_{(p)}</m> as representing a class in <m>H^0(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A})</m>, 
          we find that its image under the Bockstein differential is represented by <m>(x_{i0} - x_{i1})/p</m>.
          This is then the image of <m>dx_i \in \Omega_{R/\FF_p}</m> under <m>\eta_R</m>, and it remains to transfer the answer via <xref ref="eq-prismatic-to-derham-map"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applying <m>\phi</m> to <m>(x_{i0} - x_{i1})/p</m> yields <m>(x_{i0}^p - x_{i1}^p)/p \in D_{J^1}(P^1)</m>.
          Going down the vertical arrow <m>D_{J^1}(P^1) \to D_{J^1}(P^1) \widehat{\otimes}_{P^1} \widehat{\Omega}^1_{P^1/\ZZ_p}</m> 
          in <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline"/> yields 
          <me>
            d((x_{i0}^p - x_{i1}^p)/p) = x_{i0}^{p-1} dx_{i0} - x_{i1}^{p-1} dx_{i1}.
          </me>
          This is the image of <m>x_i^{p-1}\,dx_i</m> along the horizontal arrow 
          <m> D_{J^0}(P^0) \widehat{\otimes}_{P^0} \widehat{\Omega}^1_{P^0/\ZZ_p} \to D_{J^1}(P^1) \widehat{\otimes}_{P^1} \widehat{\Omega}^1_{P^1/\ZZ_p}</m>
          in <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline"/>. When we reduce mod <m>p</m>, we get exactly the image of <m>dx_i</m> under the Cartier map, proving the claim.
