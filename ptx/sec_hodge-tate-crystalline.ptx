      In this section, we prove the Hodge-Tate comparison theorem (<xref ref="thm-hodge-tate-comparison"/>) in the special case where the base prism
      <m>(A,I)</m> is crystalline (meaning that <m>I = (p)</m>) and the ring <m>R</m> is a polynomial ring over <m>\overline{A} = A/p</m>.
      This simultaneously shows off some key ideas and provides a crucial base case for the general argument.

    <title>de Rham cohomology in characteristic <m>p</m></title>
    <p>
      We first recall how de Rham cohomology works in characteristic <m>p</m>, focusing on the key case of an affine space (polynomial ring).
      The key point is that even in this case the cohomology is quite large, and in fact the cohomology groups reflect the structure of the original complex
      via the <term>Cartier isomorphism</term>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-frobenius-on-de-rham">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any morphism <m>R \to S</m> in <m>\Ring_{\FF_p}</m>, the map <m>\phi_S: \Omega^i_{S/R} \to \Omega^i_{S/R}</m> is zero for all <m>i \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For any <m>x \in S</m>, we have 
          <me>
            \phi_S(dx) = d\phi_S(x) = d(x^p) = px^{p-1}\,dx = 0
          </me>
          because <m>p=0</m> in <m>S</m>. This proves the claim for <m>i=1</m>, from which the rest follows at once.

      <title>Cartier isomorphism for affine space</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Choose <m>R \in \Ring_{\FF_p}</m>, put <m>S = R[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m>, and let <m>\phi_{S/R}: S^{(1)} \to S</m> be the relative Frobenius. Then the map
          <me>
            (\Omega^\bullet_{S^{(1)}/R}, 0) \stackrel{\phi_{S}}{\to} (\Omega^\bullet_{S/R}, d_{\dR})
          </me>
          is a quasi-isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We may identify <m>S^{(1)}</m> with another copy of <m>S</m> with the map <m>\phi_{S/R}</m> being the substitution <m>x_i \mapsto x_i^p</m>.
          The map <m>\phi_{S/R}</m> induces a morphism of complexes thanks to <xref ref="lem-frobenius-on-de-rham"/>. To check that this map is a quasi-isomorphism,
          we form a decomposition
          <me>
            \Omega^i_{S/R} = \bigoplus_{e_1,\dots,e_n \in \{0,\dots,p-1\}} x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_n^{e_n} \phi_{S/R}(\Omega^i_{S^{(1)}/R})
          </me>
          and note that this is a decomposition at the level of complexes (that is, the differentials respect this decomposition).
          The summand <m>e_1 = \cdots = e_n = 0</m> is the image of the map in question; it will suffice to check that every other summand has zero cohomology.
          Without loss of generality, we check this for a summand in which <m>e_1 \neq 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, 
          partial differential with respect to <m>x_1</m> restricts on <m>x_1^{e_1} \cdots x_n^{e_n} S^{(1)}</m> to multiplication by <m>e_1</m>,
          and so the summand in question is isomorphic to the totalization of the double complex
          <me>
            \Omega^\bullet_{S^{(1)}/R[x_1]} \stackrel{\times e_i}{\to} \Omega^\bullet_{S^{(1)}/R[x_1]},
          </me>
          and the arrow in the middle is an isomorphism. From this, the claim is evident.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One can easily promote <xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/> to a similar statement for any smooth morphism <m>R \to S</m> in <m>\Ring_{\FF_p}</m>.
        We omit the details here, as we will see the same argument again soon (<xref ref="lem-hodge-tate-etale-base-change"/>).

    <title>Divided powers</title>

      We next recall an algebraic construction that will help us study de Rham cohomology in mixed characteristic.
      See <xref ref="bib-Berthelot-Ogus"/>, section 3 for a detailed development, which also covers cases where the ring can have <m>\ZZ</m>-torsion.

    <definition xml:id="def-divided-power-envelope">
      <p>
        For <m>R \in \Ring</m> flat over <m>\ZZ</m>, the <term>divided power operations</term> <m>\gamma_n: R \to R \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m> are the maps

          \gamma_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n!} \qquad (x \in R, n \geq 0).

        we see that the set of <m>x \in R</m> for which <m>\gamma_n(x) \in R</m> for all <m>n \geq 0</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        For <m>J</m> an ideal contained in this ideal, we say that <m>R</m> <term>admits divided powers</term> on <m>J</m>.

      <p>
        When studying divided powers, it is common to use the initialism <term>pd</term> for the French phrase <term>puissances divisées</term>.

    <title>Divided powers in <m>\delta</m>-rings</title>
    <p>
      We next make a crucial link between <m>\delta</m>-rings and divided powers.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-divided-power-envelope-criterion">
      <p>
        If <m>R</m> is a <m>\ZZ_{(p)}</m>-algebra which admits a <m>\delta</m>-ring structure, 
        then <m>R</m> admits divided powers on some ideal <m>J</m> if and only if <m>\gamma_p(x) \in R</m> for all <m>x \in J</m>. See
        <xref ref="exer-delta-divided-power"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>R = \ZZ_{(p)}\{x\}</m> and <m>J = xR</m>, the map from <m>R</m> to the divided power envelope of <m>(R, J)</m> promotes to a morphism of <m>\delta</m>-rings.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be the divided power envelope; it is the smallest subring of <m>\ZZ_{(p)}\{x\}[p^{-1}]</m>
          containing <m>\ZZ_{(p)}\{x\}</m> and <m>\gamma_n(x)</m> for all <m>n \geq 1</m>. 
          The maximal ideal on which <m>D</m> admits divided powers includes both <m>x</m> (by construction) and <m>p</m> (by <xref ref="exa-Zp-divided-powers"/>),
          and hence also <m>\phi(x)</m>; consequently, for all <m>n \geq 1</m>,
          <me>
            \phi(\gamma_n(x)) = \gamma_n(\phi(x)) \in D.
          </me>
          Hence <m>\phi</m> induces an endomorphism of <m>D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We next check that <m>\phi</m> induces a Frobenius lift on <m>D</m>; this amounts to checking that for all <m>n \geq 1</m>,
          <me>
            \phi(\gamma_n(x)) \equiv \gamma_n(x)^p \pmod{pD}.
          </me>
          We will see that in fact both sides are divisible by <m>p</m>. For <m>\phi(\gamma_n(x)) = \gamma_n(\phi(x))</m>, this holds by writing
          <m>\phi(x) = p(x^p/p + \delta(x)) \in pD</m> and invoking <xref ref="eq-zp-divided-powers"/>. For <m>\gamma_n(x)^p</m>, this holds by writing
          <m>\gamma_n(x)^p = p! \gamma_p(\gamma_n(x))</m> and applying <xref ref="eq-divided-power-composition"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>D</m> is <m>p</m>-torsion-free, by <xref ref="lem-delta-ring-Frobenius-lift"/> we obtain a <m>\delta</m>-structure compatible with <m>R</m>, as desired.

        is independent of the choice of <m>\delta</m>-structure on <m>A</m>, as the characterization via the divided power envelope of <m>(A,I)</m> makes no

        <xref ref="lem-divided-power-envelope-delta1"/> asserts that the divided power envelope of <m>(R, J)</m> as a ring is also the divided power envelope as a

        for <m>A</m> the free <m>\lambda</m>-ring on <m>x</m> (over <m>\ZZ</m>), 
        the divided power envelope of <m>(A, (x))</m> is not a <m>\lambda</m>-subring of <m>A \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>.

        This then leads to the question of describing the smallest <m>\lambda</m>-subring of <m>A \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m> containing <m>A</m>
        which admits divided powers on <m>(x)</m>. We do not know the answer, but as a partial result we note that this ring contains the elements

          Note that <m>(P^n\{J^n/p\}^\wedge_{(p)}, (p))</m> is the <m>(n+1)</m>-fold product of <m>(P^0, (p))</m> in <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m>; 
          the inclusion of <m>f/p</m> for <m>f \in J^n</m>
          is required to ensure that we obtain a morphism of prisms. Hence we are in the setting
          described in <xref ref="rem-prismatic-cohomology-via-cosimplicial"/>.

      <p>
        With notation as in <xref ref="lem-crystalline-weakly-final"/> and <xref ref="cor-crystalline-weakly-final"/>,
        the map <m>\phi</m> on <m>A = \ZZ_p</m> is an isomorphism and <m>A \to P^\bullet</m> is an isomorphism in <m>K(\ZZ_p)</m> by the Čech-Alexander construction.
        Hence <m>\phi_{P*}: P^\bullet \to P^\bullet</m> is also an isomorphism, yielding isomorphisms in <m>K(\ZZ_p)</m> of the form
        <me>
          P^\bullet\{J^\bullet/p\}^\wedge_{(p)} \to \phi_{P^\bullet}^*(P^\bullet\{J^\bullet/p\})^\wedge_{(p)} = P^\bullet\{\phi(J^\bullet)/p\}^\wedge_{(p)}.
        </me>
        By <xref ref="cor-regular-sequence-divided-power-envelope"/>, the latter coincides with the <m>p</m>-completed 
        divided power envelope <m>D_{J^\bullet}(P^\bullet)</m>
        of <m>(P^\bullet, J^\bullet)</m>. (More precisely, these are homotopy equivalences of cosimplicial <m>\ZZ_p</m>-algebras; see again <xref ref="def-homotopy-equivalence"/>.)

        To summarize, the two rows of <xref ref="fig-replace-cech-alexander"/> are quasi-isomorphic to each other and to <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          By the Poincaré lemma (<xref ref="prop-poincare-lemma"/>), 
          each of the maps <m>P^0 \to P^n</m> induces a quasi-isomorphism <m>\widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{P^0/\ZZ_p} \to \widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{P^n/\ZZ_p}</m>.
          We can compute the cohomology of the total complex using the <q>first</q> spectral sequence, in which we first compute the cohomology of the columns.
          In this case, <m>H^m(D_{J^n}(P^n) \wedge{\otimes}_{P^n} \widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{P^n/\ZZ_p})</m> is independent of <m>n</m> and 
          the horizontal differentials between these are
          <me>
            H^m \stackrel{0}{\to} H^m \stackrel{1}{\to} H^m \stackrel{0}{\to} H^m \stackrel{1}{\to} \cdots.
          </me>
          Hence at the next page, we end up with the groups <m>H^m(D_{J^0}(P^0) \wedge{\otimes}_{P^0} \widehat{\Omega}^\bullet_{P^0/\ZZ_p})</m> in column 0 
          and zeroes elsewhere. By <xref ref="map-of-double-complex-first-column-qis"/>, the map from the first column to the totalization is a quasi-isomorphism.
          (Compare <xref ref="exa-trivial-resolution-modules"/> for a similar phenomenon.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, by <xref ref="lem-differentials-derived"/>, each row except the first is homotopic to zero.
          Consequently, by <xref ref="map-of-double-complex-first-column-qis"/> again, the natural map from the first row to the totalization is also a quasi-isomorphism.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Bhatt-deJong"/>, Theorem 2.12.)

    <proposition xml:id="thm-Hodge-Tate-crystalline-affine-space">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(A,I)</m> be the prism <m>(\ZZ_p, (p))</m> and put <m>R = \FF_p[x_1,\dots,x_n]</m>.
          Then the Hodge-Tate comparison map <xref ref="eq-Hodge-Tate-comparison-map"/> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
           By <xref ref="lem-crystalline-weakly-final"/>, we may compute the object <m>\Prism_{R/A} \in D(A)</m> using the Čech-Alexander complex associated to the weakly final object <m>(P, IP)</m>
           as described in <xref ref="cor-crystalline-weakly-final"/>, and then obtain <m>\overline{\Prism}_{R/A} \in D(\overline{A})</m> by applying <m>\otimes^L_A A/p</m>. 
           By <xref ref="rmk-identify-prismatic-product-with-divided-powers"/>, the object <m>\Prism_{R/A}</m> is represented by the top row of the double complex <xref ref="fig-double-complex-crystalline"/>, which by 
           <xref ref="lem-prismatic-double-complex"/> is isomorphic in <m>D(A)</m> to the first column of the double complex.
           By applying <m>\otimes^L_{\ZZ_p} \FF_p</m> and applying <xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/>, we obtain an isomorphism 
           <men xml:id="eq-prismatic-cartier">
             (\Omega^\bullet_{R^{(1)}/\overline{A}}, 0) \cong (H^\bullet(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}), \beta_I)
           </men>
           of complexes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <xref ref="eq-prismatic-cartier"/>, we see that <m>\eta_R^0</m> is an isomorphism; more precisely, it is 
          the map obtained from <xref ref="eq-prismatic-cartier"/> by identifying <m>R</m> with <m>R^{(1)}</m> via <m>\phi_R</m>
          (note that this corresponds to the use of Frobenius in <xref ref="rmk-identify-prismatic-product-with-divided-powers"/>.
          By computing modulo <m>p^2</m>, we may then see that the Bockstein differential 
          <m>\beta: H^0(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A}) \to H^1(\overline{\Prism}_{R/A})\{1\}</m>
          corresponds to the de Rham differential <m>d_{\dR}: R \to \Omega^1_{R/\overline{A}}</m>;
          hence <m>\eta_R^1</m> coincides with the <m>i=1</m> term of <xref ref="eq-prismatic-cartier"/>, and hence is an isomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now note that <xref ref="lem-cartier-isomorphism-affine-space"/> induces an isomorphism of dga's.
          From this and the fact that <m>\Omega^i_{R/\overline{A}} \cong \wedge^i_{\overline{A}} \Omega^1_{R/\overline{A}}</m>,
          we deduce that <m>\eta_R^i</m> is an isomorphism for all <m>i</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The use of the Cartier isomorphism in the proof of <xref ref="thm-Hodge-Tate-crystalline-affine-space"/> will eventually lead us to the fact that
        prismatic cohomology computes not crystalline cohomology <em>per se</em>, but rather a canonical Frobenius descent of it.
