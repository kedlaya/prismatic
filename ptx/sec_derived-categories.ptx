      We pick up from <xref ref="sec_homotopy-categories"/> (retaining notation) and introduce the <term>derived category</term> associated to an abelian category.
      This amounts to checking that we can perform the localization of the homotopy category <m>K(\calA)</m> at the family of quasi-isomorphisms
      (i.e., verifying the hypothesis of a multiplicative system from <xref ref="def-multiplicative-system"/>). Rather than attempting to do this directly,
      we first set up the formalism of <term>triangulated categories</term>; this will allow us to identify quasi-isomorphisms in terms of their mapping cones,
      which will facilitate the verification of the necessary conditions.

    <title>Distinguished triangles</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a short exact sequence of complexes gives rise to a long exact sequence of cohomology groups. This serves as inspiration for the following
      discussion of <term>triangles</term> in the homotopy category.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>triangle</term> in <m>\Comp(\calA)</m> is a tuple <m>(A^\bullet, B^\bullet, C^\bullet, \alpha, \beta, \delta)</m> coming from a diagram of the form
        <me>
          A^\bullet \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} B^\bullet \stackrel{\beta}{\to} C^\bullet \stackrel{\delta}{\to} A^\bullet[1]
        </me>
        which is a complex; that is, the compositions
        <md>
          <mrow>A^\bullet \to B^\bullet \to C^\bullet</mrow>
          <mrow>B^\bullet \to C^\bullet \to A^\bullet[1]</mrow>
          <mrow>C^\bullet \to A^\bullet[1] \to B^\bullet[1]</mrow>
        </md>
        are zero. We can then consider morphisms of triangles in either <m>\Comp(\calA)</m> or <m>K(\calA)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can define an operation called <term>forward rotation</term> on the set of triangles:
        <me>
          (A^\bullet, B^\bullet, C^\bullet, \alpha, \beta, \delta) \mapsto (B^\bullet, C^\bullet, A[1]^\bullet, \beta, \delta, -\alpha[1])
        </me>
        (note the minus sign). The inverse operation is <term>backward rotation</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Here is a key family of examples.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For a morphism <m>f: K^\bullet \to L^\bullet</m> in <m>\Comp(\calA)</m>, the <term>cone</term> (or <term>mapping cone</term>) of <m>f</m> is the complex
        <me>
          C(f)^n = L^n \oplus K^{n+1}, \qquad d^n_{C(f)} = \begin{pmatrix} d^n_L &amp; f^{n+1} \\ 0 &amp; -d^{n+1}_K \end{pmatrix}.
        </me>
        This complex fits into a triangle
        <me>
          K^\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to} L^\bullet \to C(f)^\bullet \to K^\bullet[1]
        </me>
        where the maps in and out of <m>C(f)^\bullet</m> are the obvious ones.
        Any triangle isomorphic to one of this form is said to be <term>distinguished</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-homological-functor">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any distinguished triangle <m>(A^\bullet, B^\bullet, C^\bullet, \alpha, \beta, \delta)</m>, the sequence
          <me>
            \cdots \to H^i(A^\bullet) \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} H^i(B^\bullet) \stackrel{\beta}{\to} H^i(C^\bullet) \stackrel{\delta}{\to} H^{i+1}(A^\bullet) \to \cdots
          </me>
          is exact. That is, <m>H^0</m> is a <term>homological functor</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We may as well start with the triangle associated to a mapping cone. In this case, the morphism <m>\delta</m> coincides with the family of connecting homomorphisms
          coming from the short exact sequence of complexes
          <me>
            0 \to L^\bullet \to C(f)^\bullet \to K^\bullet[1] \to 0
          </me>
          and so the sequence in question is just the long exact sequence in cohomology.
          Alternatively, we can first prove <xref ref="lem-distinguished-triangle-rotation"/> and then use this to reduce to checking exactness at <m>H^i(C^\bullet)</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-distinguished-triangle-rotation">

        <p>
          The set of distinguished triangles is preserved by forward and backward rotation.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The set of distinguished triangles is preserved by the shift operators, so it will be enough to check preservation by forward rotation.
          That is, given a triangle of the form
          <me>
            K^\bullet \stackrel{f}{\to} L^\bullet \stackrel{g}{\to} C(f)^\bullet \stackrel{h}{\to} K^\bullet[1]

    <title>Localization at quasi-isomorphisms</title>
    <p>
      We return to our unfinished business from <xref ref="rmk-derived-motivation3"/>, namely modifying the homotopy category so as to force every quasi-isomorphism
      to acquire an inverse. Thanks to the cone construction, we can relate quasi-isomorphisms to acyclic objects, which are easier to handle.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        An object <m>K^\bullet</m> of <m>\Comp(\calA)</m> is <term>acyclic</term> if <m>H^n(K^\bullet) = 0</m> for all <m>n \in \ZZ</m>;
        this property is preserved under isomorphisms in <m>K(\calA)</m>.
        By <xref ref="lem-homological-functor"/>, if two of the three complexes in a distinguished triangle are acyclic, then so is the third.
        From this (and the preservation of the acyclic property under shifts) we may deduce that 
        the full subcategory of <m>K(\calA)</m> consisting of acyclic objects is also a triangulated category.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-quasi-isomorphism-from-triangle">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A morphism <m>f: K^\bullet \to L^\bullet</m> in <m>K(\calA)</m> is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if there exists a distinguished triangle
          <m>(K^\bullet, L^\bullet, M^\bullet, f, g, h)</m> in which <m>M^\bullet</m> is acyclic.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is immediate from <xref ref="lem-homological-functor"/>, using the mapping cone for the <q>only if</q> direction.

      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-quasi-isomorphisms-multiplicative">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The set of quasi-isomorphisms in <m>K(\calA)</m> is a saturated multiplicative system in the sense of <xref ref="def-multiplicative-system"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It suffices to check the conditions for a left multiplicative system, as the symmetric argument will imply the conditions for a right multiplicative system.
          The first condition in <xref ref="def-multiplicative-system"/> is evidently satisfied: every identity morphism is a quasi-isomorphism, and any composition
          of quasi-isomorphisms is a quasi-isomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          To check the second condition, apply <xref ref="cor-extend-to-distinguished-triangle"/> to fit <m>g</m> into a distinguished triangle <m>(X, Y, Z, g, h, i)</m>,
          then set <m>Y' = C(i[-1])</m>; we obtain the map <m>s</m> by filling the diagram <xref ref="fig-triangulated-category-fillin2"/> using
          <xref ref="lem-distinguished-triangle-rotation"/> (to rotate) and <xref ref="cor-distinguished-triangle-fillin"/>.
          (We deduce from <xref ref="lem-homological-functor"/> that <m>s</m> is a quasi-isomorphism.)

          Apply <xref ref="cor-extend-to-distinguished-triangle"/> to fit <m>t</m> into a distinguished triangle <m>(Z, X, Q, t, d, h)</m>.

          By <xref ref="lem-quasi-isomorphism-from-triangle"/>, <m>t</m> being a quasi-isomorphism implies that <m>Q</m> is acyclic,

        Suppose that <m>\calA</m> is a small abelian category. By <xref ref="prop-quasi-isomorphisms-multiplicative"/>, we may apply
        <xref ref="def-left-localization"/> to construct the localization of <m>K(\calA)</m> at the saturated multiplicative system of quasi-isomorphisms.
        The result is called the <term>derived category</term> of <m>\calA</m>, denoted <m>D(\calA)</m>. Similarly, we may define the
        <term>bounded below derived category</term> <m>D^+(\calA)</m>, the
        <term>bounded above derived category</term> <m>D^-(\calA)</m>, and the
        <term>bounded derived category</term> <m>D(\calA)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important case is when <m>\calA</m> is the category of modules over a ring <m>A</m>. This is not a small category, but modulo
        set-theoretic issues (see <xref ref="rmk-derived-category-ring"/>) we can still define <m>D^*(\calA)</m> for <m>* \in \{\emptyset, -, +, b\}</m>;

    <remark xml:id="rmk-derived-category-ring">

        To work around the fact that the derived category construction requires a small abelian category as input, one can view the full category <m>\Mod_A</m>
        as a 2-colimit of full subcategories consisting of modules of increasingly larger cardinalities. This works because <m>\Mod_A</m> is not just an abelian
        category but a <term>Grothendieck abelian category</term>; see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 09PA.
        For a more general abelian category <m>\calA</m>, however, the set-theoretic difficulty becomes a genuine obstruction; see <xref ref="bib-Stacks"/>, tag 07JS.

    <remark>
      <p>
        Just as the properties of the category <m>\Mod_A</m> are abstracted by the notion of an <term>abelian category</term>,
        the properties of homotopy categories and derived categories are abstracted by the notion of a <term>triangulated category</term>.
        A triangulated category is an additive category equipped with a collection of <term>distinguished triangles</term>

    <title>Derived functors</title>
    <p>
      At last, we can fulfill the promise we made in <xref ref="rmk-derived-motivation"/>.

    <definition>
      <p>
        Suppose that the abelian category <m>\calA</m> has enough injectives (e.g., <m>\calA = \Mod_A</m>). Then every object <m>M \in \calA</m> admits an injective resolution;
        more generally, every object of <m>K^+(\calA)</m> admits a canonical quasi-isomorphism to a canonical object of <m>K^+(\calA)</m> which can be represented by
        a complex of injective objects. This quasi-isomorphism becomes an isomorphism in <m>D^+(\calA)</m>, meaning that <em>every</em> object can be represented
        by a complex of injectives!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>F: \calA \to \calA'</m> be a left exact functor. The right derived functors <m>R^i F</m> can then be evaluated on <m>M</m>
        by taking cohomology of the object <m>F(I^\bullet)</m>; in fact, we can think of <m>M \mapsto F(I^\bullet)</m> as defining a single <term>derived functor</term>
        <m>RF: \calA \to D^+(\calA)</m>. Moreover, every object of <m>D^(\calA)</m> can likewise be resolved by injectives, so we can extend the derived functor
        to <m>RF: D^+(\calA) \to D^(\calA)</m>.

                The derived <m>I</m>-complete objects of <m>D(A)</m> form a full triangulated subcategory which is closed under derived inverse limits.

      In general, an <m>A</m>-module admits derived <m>I</m>-completions <q>as a module</q> (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian"/>)
      and <q>as a complex</q> (<xref ref="prop-derived-complete-abelian-derived"/>), with the former being <m>H^0</m> of the latter. However,
      these can interact in unexpected ways.

        Take <m>A = \ZZ, I = (p), M = \QQ/\ZZ</m>. Then the ordinary completion of <m>M</m> vanishes, as does the derived completion of <m>M</m>

          Let <m>A \to B</m>, <m>A \to C</m> be morphisms of lenses. Then the derived <m>p</m>-completion of <m>B \otimes_A^L C</m> has cohomology only in degree

          It is clear that <m>R = B^\flat \otimes_{A^\flat} C^\flat</m> is perfect. By <xref ref="exer-perfect-tor"/>, 
          we also have <m>R \cong B^\flat \otimes_{A^\flat}^L C^\flat</m> in <m>D(A^\flat)</m>. Applying the Witt vector functor, we obtain an isomorphism
          <m>W(R) \cong W(B^\flat) \widehat{\otimes}^L_{W(A^\flat)} W(C^\flat)</m> where <m>\widehat{\otimes}^L</m> denotes the derived <m>p</m>-completion
          of the derived tensor product. Write <m>A \cong W(A^\flat)/d</m> with <m>d \in W(A^\flat)</m> distinguished (<xref ref="lem-perfect-prisms-structure"/>).
          Since <m>d</m> is a non-zerodivisor in <m>W(A^\flat), W(B^\flat), W(C^\flat)</m> (<xref ref="lem-distinguished-perfect"/>),
          we get an isomorphism <m>W(R)/(d) \cong B \widehat{\otimes}^L_A C</m>. This proves the claim.
