      In this section, we give a minimal treatment of the theory of <term>derived categories</term> in order to be able to operate
      fluently with these in the sequel.

      <p>
        Take <m>A = \ZZ, I = (p), M = \QQ/\ZZ</m>. Then the ordinary completion of <m>M</m> vanishes, as does the derived completion of <m>M</m>
        <em>as a module</em>, but the derived completion of <m>M</m> <em>as a complex</em> is the group <m>\ZZ_p</m> concentrated in degree 1.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> be a <m>\delta</m>-ring and let <m>I</m> be a finitely generated ideal of <m>A</m> containing <m>p</m>.
          Prove that the derived <m>I</m>-completion of <m>A</m> (as a module) admits a unique <m>\delta</m>-ring structure compatible with <m>A</m>.
          (That is, <xref ref="exer-delta-ring-completion"/> remains true when the classical completion is replaced by the derived completion.)

      <hint>
        <p>
          Use the characterization of <m>\delta</m>-structures on <m>A</m> in terms of <m>W_2(A)</m> (<xref ref="rmk-W2-interpretation"/>).
